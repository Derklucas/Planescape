## Description

The Doomguard understands the purpose of everything is to crumble. Existence inevitably falls into ruinâ€”nothing lasts forever, not even the gods. 

Sinkers don't stand in the way of the multiverse's destruction. They see decay and entropy as entirely natural, something to be fostered in its own time. They don't recklessly hasten destruction or oppose creation. Instead, they see that every act of creation is intrinsically tied to destruction. Trees must be felled and stone cut to build a house, and the house must eventually burn, rot, or wither away. 

The highest-ranking Doomguard members aside from the factol are the doom lords, who each oversee a faction citadel built at the edge of the Elemental Chaos. 

The Doomguard's leader is the fearless Factol Pentar, who revels in danger and decay. Pentar has come to blows with Harmonium patrols on many occasions. She toys with the idea of aligning with the Hands of Havoc, hoping to toss a spark into the mass of dry razorvine that is Sigil.
