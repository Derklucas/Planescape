## Description

To the Fated, the multiverse belongs to those with the strength to take it. Destiny and the will of the gods are poor excuses used by folk too weak to go after what they want—everyone makes their own fate. At the same time, nothing's free. It takes work, dedication, and sometimes blood to seize greatness. 

There's no inherent malice in the Fated's philosophy. It takes more than material wealth to provide for one's needs, and not everything worth having can be taken by force. Respect and happiness, for example, must be earned (or bought). Still, Takers are branded as callous and selfish, if not outright feared, and they never offer assistance willingly unless it benefits them in some way. 

Factol Rowan Darkwood holds the reins of the Fated in his tightfisted grip. "Duke" Darkwood, as he's sometimes known, is a commanding presence whose every step is an implacable stride toward his next prize. With brutal efficiency, he exploits the financial stranglehold his faction has over Sigil, richly rewarding informants for secrets that might give the Fated leverage over the other factions.
