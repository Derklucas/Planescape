## Description

The Transcendent Order holds that for a person to attain a higher state of being, they must unify their mind and body until thought and action are one. Those who act on instinct alone can achieve perfect harmony with the multiverse. 

Members of the Transcendent Order rigorously train every aspect of self to align with the cadence of the multiverse. Ciphers are encouraged toward athletic regiments, but many also pursue artistic endeavors to perfection, becoming dancers, virtuosos, or abstract painters. Whatever resonates with a Cipher's path, they must practice until the body no longer requires the mind to guide it. 

Factol Rhys stepped up to take control of the Transcendent Order when the last factol achieved perfect understanding and vanished right in front of Rhys and other ranking Ciphers. Rhys is an enlightening coach, providing direction to trainees with choice remarks.
