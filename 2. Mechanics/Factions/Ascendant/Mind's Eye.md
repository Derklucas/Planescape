## Description

The Mind's Eye sees experience and exploration as the means of fully realizing one's own potential. By taking in the challenges and wonders of the multiverse, individuals can leverage their perspectives and insights not only to improve themselves, but also to shape reality as they see fit. 

Growth and understanding are the keys to the Mind's Eye philosophy. Members advocate for experiential learning based on observation and experimentation instead of formal study. Every Seeker practices some craft to shape their experiences into something new and refine themselves in turn. 

The Mind's Eye arose when two former factions, the Believers in the Source and the Sign of One, merged their philosophies together into a formula by which individuals seek to transcend their potential and attain the power of gods. Even still, Seekers suspect that divinity isn't the ultimate expression of their core beliefs, but rather a stepping stone to an unknowable state of superior being. 

Factol Saladryn guides the relatively young faction. She rarely sojourns beyond Sigil anymore, sacrificing her own journey of personal discovery to lead the Mind's Eye. Saladryn focuses her energy on creation, practicing many crafts she's learned in her centuries of life.
