## Description

The Society of Sensation perceives the multiverse through experiences—the more varied, the better. By experiencing all there is—every sensation, emotion, thought, everything—one can learn and understand the entirety of existence. 

Sensates live each moment as if it were the only one that ever mattered, drinking it in to know another sliver of reality. Many Sensates, particularly new members, focus only on experiences that delight the senses, but as Sensates grow, they aim to experience every facet of existence, even the bad ones. Sweet fragrances and savory bites must be balanced with the sting of failure, the weight of responsibility, and the gnawing ache of grief. 

The Society of Sensation pays a price for its lack of inhibition. Outsiders view Sensates as flighty, lascivious, or untrustworthy, always jumping from one event to the next. For a Sensate, to dwell on one endeavor is to deny the truth of existence. 

Factol Erin Darkflame Montgomery guides the society through every lingering exploration. Factol Montgomery ensures that Sensates maintain a balance of cerebral pursuits, physical experiences, and deliberate contemplation, knowing the harm that pleasure-seeking alone can cause.
