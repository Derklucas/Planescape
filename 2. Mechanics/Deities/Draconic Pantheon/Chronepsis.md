Chronepsis, the dragon god of fate, death, and judgment; a proper mysterious figure he is, the unblinking eye of the fate of dragon kind. He’s known by planewalkers as The Watcher, and he’s a sight to behold, let me tell you cutter. Imagine a dragon, but not like those shiny metallics or the flashy chromatics, no sir. He’s colourless, with skin as dull and decaying as the Dead Nations, and bones yellowed like aged parchment peeking through. Floating above his head is a magical brass harp, strings plucking like a constant reminder of the ever-ticking passage of time. He’s the embodiment of neutrality, so much so that he’s practically an outsider to all of scalykind, not siding with either metallic or chromatic dragons.

His philosophy is as dispassionate as a gravestone. Chronesis doesn’t care two jinks about the unfolding of events, he just observes and guides the spirits of dragons to the afterlife. He’s the strong, silent type; the chant goes he never speaks—or even communicates. Some say he knows the future and the end of all things, but good luck getting him to spill the beans.

In the tales spun around Sigil and beyond, Chronepsis is often linked to Io, the high-up of dragon deities. Some yarns paint him as Io’s son or perhaps his brother. They say it’s like Chronepsis is the closing circle to Io’s ever-sprawling existence. As Io expands, Chronepsis is there to reel everything back in, in perfect balance.

The chant goes that Chronepsis spends most of the time in his Mausoleum, a sprawling ruin of a realm beneath an abandoned city. When he’s not down there tending to his hourglasses, they say he ferries the souls of dead dragons to Dragon Eyrie, ensuring their safe passage to the fabled realm of dragon petitioners. Because dragons don’t get written into the dead book that often, Chronepsis spends most of his time in his mausoleum, watching and waiting.

What’s curious about Chronepsis is how he stands alone. He’s got no connections to other draconic powers, nor other pantheons, and he’s now got any known allies—or enemies. Sure, he’s got a bit in common with old Boccob in terms of outlook, but don’t go thinking they’re close. And despite his lofty position as power of draconic lifespans, not many dragons are lining up to worship him. They respect him, alright, but reverence? That’s rare. Fewer still are those who tread the path of his clergy. Perhaps dragons don’t like to think too long about their own mortality. That’s what comes of being an unspeakably powerful beast, I suppose.

So there you have it, berk. Chronepsis, a god as neutral as they come, holding the scales of fate and time with an unblinking eye. He’s the quiet observer, the inevitable end, respected by all but distant, like the stars in the sky.
