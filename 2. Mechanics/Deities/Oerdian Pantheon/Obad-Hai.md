Obad-Hai is the deity of nature. He is a patron of druids and a friend to those who dwell in harmony with their natural surroundings. Characters or creatures who despoil or wantonly harm either animal or vegetable life are his foes.

### Worship
Obad-Hai's faith has developed mainly in wooded regions under human dominance. Most of the worshipers of Obad-Hai are human or half-elves. It is also reported that gnomes, hobbits, certain woodland creatures, fey and very rare dwarfs pay homage to him. They serve as protectors of nature, acting as the agents of retribution when their protection is insufficient or too late.  
  
Most of Obad-Ha√Ø's followers are simple people, living in contact with nature. They are hunters, gatherers, peasants, loggers, shepherds, etc. They live with nature on a daily basis and it is where they draw their sustenance. For this reason, game, plants, trees, forests are precious, even sacred, to them.

#### Hierarchy
The clergy is in fact exclusively made up of druids, no hierarchy exists and the druids treat each other as equals, regardless of level. However, the elders of a congregation are always listened to with respect, the highest wisdom coming with age. The Obad-Hai druids located in the same geographical area constitute a branch of their order.

#### Vestments
Obad-Hai's clerics wear russet-colored clothing, with vines, leaves and twigs often intertwined into the fabric. They often carry quarterstaves.

#### Temples
All the churches and chapels dedicated to Obad-Hai are made of wooden logs. Their interior is always sober and functional. Most of them are simple huts. They are found in rustic places, most often small villages on the fringes of civilization. However, there are some very elaborate ones, which can sometimes be in the trees, which host powerful Druidic congregations. They are found in the deepest forests, out of sight of men. These temples are usually defended by dozens of guardian animals and other denizens of the wilderness, many of whom are content to observe visitors from a distance.  
  
All Druid shrines are sacred areas, imbued with the magic of nature. They generally consist of oaks planted in concentric circles around a pool of clear water.

### Dogma
No one can live a happy life if he does not know how to live in harmony with nature in all its forms. Those who harm nature deserve swift vengeance in an appropriate manner. Those who are one with nature, however, have little to fear, although the well-meaning but foolish are sometimes brought down by a danger they could not avoid or divert. The wilds can sometimes be ugly, dangerous, or terrible, but that these things are a part of nature and should be respected as much as those that are beautiful, harmless, or wonderful, for these characterizations mark a newcomer's perspective.

### Appearance and manifestations
Obad-Hai is most often shown as a lean and weathered man of indeterminately old age, dressed in brown or russet and looking like a hermit, although nonhuman communities depict him as one of their own race. He plays a shalm (a double-reed woodwind musical instrument, also spelled "shawm") and takes his title from this instrument. He also carries a staff.

### Relationships and History
Because Obad-Hai strictly adheres to neutrality, his primary rival is that of Ehlonna, however their rivalry is more so that of intellectual then aggressive (i.e. taking up arms against one another). While Obad-Hai is a chief nature deity, his brother Rillifane Rallathil of The Seldarine is worshipped by the Elves.
