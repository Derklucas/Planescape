Boccob is the god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight. He is recognized throughout Flanaess as the god of magic and knowledge. As such, seers and soothsayers implore him for omens, the sages consult him to decipher arcane and the mages often seek his help to create magic objects or new spells.  
  
Boccob is nicknamed the Uncaring because he cares little for the fate of people, nor whether he is worshiped or not. Boccob rarely has any desire to interfere with events occurring on Oerth. He is the least interested of the deities, having no agenda to push.  
  
Boccob stands apart from the other gods and almost never leaves the halls of his library located in the Outer Lands, preferring to send his servant, Zagyg the Mad, to represent him. In his halls, it is claimed that he holds at least one copy of each magic object (with the exception of artifacts and relics) never designed by mages or illusionists and a copy of all the alchemy formulas written to it. day. Despite his immeasurable knowledge, Boccob always seeks to learn more about the structures of the Planes, profane magic and forgotten legends.  
  
Among the Bakluni, Boccob is known as Al'Zarad, the god of Magic and Learning, portraying him with Baklunish facial features. Regarded as a creation of Istus, Al'Zarad has few worshipers.

### Worship
The cult of Boccob is disdained by ordinary people and its followers are almost all scribes, sages, soothsayers or mages. They often have a small personal altar and practice their faith in discretion, only very rarely going to a temple. He is known to every culture.  
  
The members of the Boccob clergy have a quest identical to that of their god: collecting as much knowledge as possible, guided by a pure and objective spirit of absolute neutrality. The magic of the mysteries is not venerated as such, but as a formidable tool put at the disposal of those who manage to master it. Creating spells or magic items is a sacred task.

#### Hierarchy
Standing within the church is determined based upon one's contributions to knowledge and magic. Thus, many sages and wizards hold sway within this organization. There is no overall hierarchy within Boccob's church. Individual temples determine who is in charge, though they all use the same format for determining temple leadership. A council of five selects the church leader based upon the quality and quantity of an individual's research and scholarly writings during the previous five years, and the individual's knowledge of arcane lore, as determined through five days of testing. Any priest may take these tests, regardless of level. Once chosen, the temple's administrator holds that office for five years.

#### Vestments
Ceremonial garments are purple, enhanced with gold, and decorated with intricate patterns and esoteric symbols. In some temples, the difficulty of deciphering the runes embroidered on a robe is indicative of the level of the priest. The more obscure the runic language, the more important the priest in the temple.

#### Temples
Official temples (called theÂ _Bastions of Knowledge_) are rare and are almost all found in only the largest cities. In fact, most places of worship come down to small altars in libraries, schools of magic, or in the home of a worshiper. Some priests erect their homes away from civilization, in places difficult to access. However, young priests travel a lot, moving from city to city, from place of knowledge to place of magic, and then celebrate worship on altars more or less improvised.

### Dogma
Balance takes precedence over Good, Evil, Law or Chaos. We must reject the incursions of Good as the oppression of Evil. We must repeal overly rigid laws, without sinking into anarchy for that. Magic is the most important thing that the world offers us and it is necessary to preserve it so as not to upset the balance. Magic is neither good nor bad, neither fair nor chaotic, and it is best to exercise it in a spirit devoid of ethical judgments.

### Appearance and manifestations
Boccob is usually portrayed as a middle aged man with white hair who wears purple robes decorated with golden runes. He is described as carrying the very first staff of the magi with him at all times. In addition, he knows every spell ever created and can travel to any time and dimension. He is the possessor of the only magical library that contains a copy of every potion, spell, and magic item in existence.

### Relationships and History
Boccob guided the apotheosis of his servant, Zagyg. He is allied with Delleb. The Archmage of the Deities is opposed to Tharizdun, who he believes is slowly draining magic from the Oerth.
