Let me tell you the chant about Zilchus, the Great Guildmaster, a deity whose realm is the almighty coin, power, and the web of commerce that binds the multiverse. He’s as Oeridian as they come, and is usually depicted as a blood in fine garb, plain in looks but dripping with wealth. 

Now, Zilchus, he’s not one for dallying in petty trifles like jink; his eyes are set on the bigger prize—influence, deals, and the flow of gold itself. His philosophy? Desire for dosh might drive a man, but mastering that desire in oneself while exploiting it in others; that’s where true power lies. According to the teachings of Zilchus, everything, be it politics or war, is just another form of trade, each with its own currency.

His clerics are a hard-nosed lot, ruthless in the cutthroat world of business, often seen as cold-hearted by those who don’t understand the stakes. They’re the movers and shakers behind guilds, caravans, and the cutters who burn the proverbial incense in the smoke-filled corridors of power, making sure their—and their deity’s—interests are well looked after. The fresh recruits might start off overseeing caravans or out-of-the-way businesses, but the ambitious ones quickly find themselves in the thick of high-stakes games, dealing with the likes of Sigil’s Golden Lord movers or the shakers of the Planar Trade Consortium.

### Worship
Zilchus is revered primarily by those who are fair, honest, and scrupulous in their dealings; shady merchants are more likely to look to his brother Kurell instead. In any place where trade is active (primarily in urban areas, as rural areas are too poor to offer interesting market prospects), most buyers who seek the guarantees of an honest transaction turn to the clergy of Zilchus.  
  
Besides merchants, Zilchus is revered by a few nobles and wealthy people. Its cult is essentially urban, his priests are less active in rural communities (often too poor to offer interesting market prospects.

#### Hierarchy
Each temple is relatively independent but the patriarch Stakaster Villaine, member of the oligarchy of the Free City of Greyhawk, is the recognized head of the church and each chapter must respect his word and his directives.

#### Vestments
Priests must put on their finest attire during ceremonies. Most often, they wear white silk underwear, a gray dress decorated with silver with puffed sleeves, quality boots and various useful items hanging from the end of ribbons. They can also put on a tunic, pants, white gloves, tights or a tabard, but such clothes should always be cut from rich textiles. The set can be covered with a red cape covered with embroidery and weighed down by numerous precious metal additions. The high priests must also wear a golden mitre (a pope's hat), set with precious stones.  
  
When in town, priests often dress like wealthy merchants and do not hesitate to adapt their attire to local customs.

#### Temples
Zilchus has few temples but many shrines in offices and guild halls.

### Dogma
"The best society is open, dominated by commerce and business, governed by a law that punishes criminals and recognized contracts and agreements. Trade and wealth are the pillars of society, on which everything is built and flourishes. It is trade that allows the blacksmith to obtain his food as a reward for his efforts, and the farmer to buy the tools he needs for his labor. The wealth produced by trade strengthens society as a whole, and those who work the hardest gain more prestige, power and influence."

### Appearance and manifestations
Zilchus is depicted as a well-dressed Oeridian man of plain appearance but great wealth. He is middle-aged, with brown hair and eyes, tanned skin, and a dignified demeanor, and depicted as smiling. His clothing is expensive without being ostentatious. He carries a gold purse and a flail with which to chastise the dishonest.

### Relationships and History
Zilchus is the brother of Kurell, and the husband of Sotillion (and thus related by marriage to Procan, Merikka, and the Velaeri).  
  
Zilchus' allies include almost all lawful gods, whether good, neutral or bad, these adhering to varying degrees with the idea of ​​a society governed by strict laws in which commerce can flourish. Zilchus is closely allied with Rao, for Rao tries to calm the quarrels between the gods and to convince them to establish an agreement under the mediation of Zilchus. Their relationship is however sometimes tense, Rao hardly forgiving Zilchus for supporting the slave trade and associating with evil powers such as Hextor.  
  
Zilchus became estranged from Kurell when the thief-god spurned Atroa in order to pursue Zilchus' own love, Sotillion. Kurell now lives alone with his jealousies, although it is said that the others would forgive him if only he would ask.  
  
Xerbo is said to sulk whenever Zilchus encroaches on his followers, but they are not said to be enemies.
