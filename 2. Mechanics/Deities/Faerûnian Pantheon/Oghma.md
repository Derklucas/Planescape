Oghma, also known as The Lord of Knowledge, is the deity of bards, inspiration, invention, and knowledge in Faerûn. His portfolio is rather large, covering anything to do with coming up with new intellectual pursuits: whether it be poems, symphonies, prose, art, mathematical, architecture, crafts, etc. Oghma was the leader of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention and his home plane was the House of Knowledge.

Oghma is a cheerful and wise power whose ability to persuade others to his point of view he puts to endless use. He can be solemn and righteous, but he is more often quietly humorous and quick to smile. His one flaw may be his fondness for his own thoughts; he tends to implement rather convoluted plots that he has worked out first in his own mind rather than to take direct action.

### Worship
Oghma's followers are those who seek knowledge and wish to spread it to the corners of Phrelle. His worshipers typically include bards, wizards, seekers of knowledge, librarians, scribes, inventors, and cartographers.  
  
The clergy of Oghma all carry secondary jobs outside their religious duties. While in many smaller cities and towns these priests also take on the jobs of teachers, librarians, and scribes. In most communities the temple is a place of learning as well. Priests of Oghma refer to themselves as "Loremasters."

#### Hierarchy
Acolytes in the service of the Binder are called _Seekers_, and those of some accomplishments are _Senior Seekers_. When an acolyte demonstrates clear (good and useful) inspiration, solid service in Oghma's cause, or true loyalty to the god to the discernment of at least two priests of the Wise God; those two priests confirm the acolyte as a true priest of Oghma, bestowing upon him the title of _Loremaster_. Those who rise in the service of Oghma may win various titles in different places and jurisdictions, but the most widely recognized hierarchy of ranks (in ascending order) is: _Loremaster_, _Loremaster Amanuensis_, _Loremaster Venturer_, _Loremaster Bold_, _Lore-Scribe of the God_, _Wise Anticipator_, _Inspirator_, _Inspirator High_, _Atlar_, _Higher Atlar_, _Loremaster High_, _Loremaster Most High_, _Eye of Oghma_, _Divine Hand of Oghma_.

#### Vestments
All priests of Oghma have the same ceremonial dress - white shirt and trousers with a vest of black and gold brocade. The shirt sleeves are wide, but tied at the wrists. The vests, known as kantlara, depict many glyphs, sigils, runes, and symbols of magical power, arcane meaning, and significance in various realms of Faerûn down through the ages. Such markings are sewn on by the wearer using gold braid. They may be of any sort and size and are displayed on any spot on the garment that the wearer desires. At any time a priest ascends a level, she or he usually sees the symbol to be sewn in a dream vision. Kantlara are thus personal and individual garments.

#### Temples
Far more common in cities than the wilderness, temples of Oghma resemble libraries filled with acolytes huddled over desks covered in books, maps, and scrolls.

### Dogma
Knowledge, particularly the raw knowledge of ideas, is supreme. An idea has no weight, but it can move mountains. The greatest gift of humankind, an idea outweighs anything made by mortal hands. Knowledge is power and must be used with care, but hiding it away from others is never a good thing. Stifle no new ideas, no matter how false and crazed they seem; rather, let them be heard and considered. Never slay a singer, nor stand by as others do so. Spread knowledge wherever it is prudent to do so. Curb and deny falsehoods, rumor, and deceitful tales whenever you encounter them. Write or copy lore of great value at least once a year and give it away. Sponsor and teach bards, scribes, and record keepers. Spread truth and knowledge so that all folk know more. Never deliver a message falsely or incompletely. Teach reading and writing to those who ask (if your time permits), and charge no fee for the teaching.

### Appearance and manifestations
Oghma's most common form is a kindly old man dressed in simple priest vestments.  
  
Oghma, when not in human form, is represented as a flash of light that speaks in the voice of an old man, a series of notes preceding his arrival. The only knowledge forbidden to follower of Oghma is the exact tone and order of this song, and those who attempt to recreate it will find themselves warned once, and destroyed the second time.

### Relationships and History
Oghma's most common foes were Mask, Cyric, and Bane. Oghma's old archnemesis, Leira, is now dead and an aspect of Cyric. He may have been opposed to [[Ilsensine]].  
  
Along with Milil, Deneir, and [[Gond Wonderbringer |Gond]], Oghma was one of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention. He led the deific group and, although Deneir was lost, Oghma continued to lead them.
