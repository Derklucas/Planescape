Goibhniu [pronounced: GUV-new or GWIV-new] is the master smith of the Celtic pantheon; now there’s a blood who knows his way around a forge. His craftsmanship is legendary—weapons and armour that’d make any power in the multiverse drool with envy. They say what he forges never breaks or misses its target, and that’s no idle boast. He’s called Goibhniu by the Tuatha de Danann, and Gofannon by the Welsh powers, who he also associates with.

This god is picky about who he works for, reserving his finest craftwork for powers of some standing. But for those mortals he fancies, he crafts these special amulets that bounce spells right back at the caster.

Goibhniu’s realm, the Great Smithy, is nestled at the base of a hill in Tir na Og, and the ever-burning forge fires mean that it glows like a beacon in the night. The sound of hammers is like percussion, never stopping, whether it’s Goibhniu himself at the anvil or his army of apprentice smiths. The realm is deeper than it looks, packed with veins of precious ore for all their smithing needs.

Now, Goibhniu and Hephaestus, the Greek god of the forge, they’re like two peas in a pod, always trading secrets of the forge. They could be rivals, but their love for smithing keeps things friendly. Ama-Tsu-Mara, the Japanese deity, though, he’s green with envy over Goibhniu’s skills, and there’s always a bit of one-upmanship between them.

Goibhniu’s got two proxies, Luchta and Creidhne, an elf and a dwarf, respectively. These bloods were almost gods in their own right before they threw in with Goibhniu. They used to be a trio, playing by the Rule of Threes, but they sacrificed their power to boost Goibhniu. They reckon by lifting him up, they’ll rise too. It’s a gamble, but in the planes, what isn’t?
