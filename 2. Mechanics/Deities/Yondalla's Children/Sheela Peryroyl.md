Sheela Peryroyl, the Green Sister, now she’s a bit of an odd duck among Yondalla’s Children—the Halfling Pantheon—having set up her kip on the Outlands rather than in Yondalla’s realm on Venya. Sheela is more keen than most halflings on keepin’ a balance ‘tween wild greenery and tilled fields. She’s the one who looks after nature and agriculture, making sure the druids and farmers ain’t stepping on each other’s toes.

Now, during that jolly old mess that the Primes called the Spellplague and Second Sundering, Sheela found herself in the spotlight. Yondalla, you see, was all tangled up with Chauntea, and that put Sheela right up front as the high-up for the halflings. But don’t think she was over the moon about it. Nah, once things settled down, she slipped back into the shadows. Truth be told, most halflings prefer the quiet life, and Sheela’s no different.

But don’t go thinking Sheela’s all work and no play. Far from it! She’s got a hand in the revelry too—feasts, dances, love-struck romances, the whole bit. She’s about living life with a bit of zing, and her petitioners in the Flowering Hill of the Outlands, they’re all in on it. They want to live like Sheela teaches, lives full of gusto and joy, and they’re always up for showing a cutter the ropes.

### Worship
The church of Sheela is widely revered among halflings, nearly as much as that of Yondalla herself. While not all halflings are farmers, most share the Green Sister's reverence for growing things and appreciate the balance she works to maintain between untamed and settled lands. Dwarves, gold elves, moon elves, and gnomes generally work well with the church of the Green Sister, while many wild elves feel that Sheela's priests care more about new farms than preserving those wild spaces that remain. Humans tend to view the church of Sheela as a mix between that of Chauntea and Silvanus.  
  
In the farmlands, Sheela's clerics and druids (known collectively as _Green Children_) mediate disputes between growers, sanctify marriages, free harvests from natural or unnatural blights, and protect the community from animals and beasts. Many priests tend gardens of their own, seeking to develop new strains of crops and flowers. Others protect wilderness regions from careless exploitation of their resources. Members of Sheela's clergy oversee the integrity of halfling lands, leading their inhabitants through the annual calendar of seed-sowing and harvest festivals. They also try to keep the wild creatures from running rampant through settled halfling areas by guiding them to travel, live, or grow around the communities, not in or through them.  
  
Many of her clerics and druids multiclass as rangers. They turn rather than rebuke undead.

#### Hierarchy
Novices of the _Green Children_ are known as _Seedlings_. Full priests of Sheela are known as _Green Daughters_ and _Green Sons_. In ascending order of rank, the titles used by Sheelite priests are _Daisy Maid (or Lad)_, _Seed Sower_, _Nature Nurturer_, _Plant Grower_, _Crop Harvester_, _Seed Pollinator_, _Sun Shower_, and _Watchful Sister (or Brother)_. High-ranking priests have unique individual titles. Specialty priests are druids and _Greenfosters_. _Greenfosters_ concentrate on operating in and around halfling villages and farms, while druids go wherever they are needed.

#### Vestments
Sheelite priests favor simple green robes festooned with garlands of vibrant hue and embroidered with flowers. In their hair they wear only flowers, and their feet are left bare so as to feel the earth from which Sheela's bounty flows. The holy symbol of the faith is mistletoe or a sprig of holly with berries in a pinch.  
  
Members of Sheela's clergy avoid situations requiring combat, if possible. Few carry more than a blade of grass, trusting the favor of the goddess to allow them to create a reed staff and enhance it with a _shillelagh_ spell. When conflict is inevitable, Sheelite priests favor armor made from natural components - leather armor and wooden shields - and weapons associated with nature or the harvest—clubs, quarterstaves, sickles, and slings.

#### Temples
Sheela open-roofed temples appear to be woven into the surrounding landscape. Constructed of earth, stone, curtains of fine vines, and carefully balanced rocks and living plants, and they are usually found in the heart of agricultural valleys surrounded by wilderness. Interior rooms are overflowing with life, both animal and plant, and most are constructed so that streams meander through the central courtyards and so that summer breezes and sunlight bathe every chamber. Those used to the structured rooms of "civilized" regions often find the growth and life here chaotic and disconcerting, but Sheela's clerics and druids insist there are patterns in the wilderness, and that these patterns maintain a delicate balance.

### Dogma
Living in harmony with nature requires a careful balance between the wild and the tame, the feral and the tended. The need to preserve wild growth is equal to the need to take in the harvest. While nature can be adapted, it should be evolved, never forced; work within the framework of what already exists.

### Appearance and manifestations
Sheela is generally depicted as a pretty halfling maiden with brightly colored wildflowers woven in her hair. Lore states that she is quiet, though her face is smiling and her eyes are dancing. She may also be depicted as laughing. According to myth her singing causes flowers to bloom, trees to bud, and seeds to sprout, and living plants grow and flower wherever her feet have touched the earth. She is said to bring good weather when she is pleased, but may also summon droughts or floods if she is angry.

### Relationships and History
Sheela counts all her pantheon as allies, but is closest to the inscrutable Urogalan, appreciating his aspect as Lord of the Earth. All Toril's nonevil nature deities value her as a cool mind and level-headed thinker capable of disarming tense diplomatic issues with forthright honesty and warming smiles. Such qualities make her the perfect "celestial mediator" when tensions flare between such worthies as Silvanus and Waukeen. This role has transcended to the mortal realm, where even some nonhalflings give honor to Sheela Peryroyl before entering a pact or important negotiation.
