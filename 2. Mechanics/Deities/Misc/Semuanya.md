Semuanya embodies the primal lizardfolk instincts of survival and propagation. Their philosophy reflects the fundamental essence of life, stripped of moral or ethical considerations. Semuanya manifests as an outsized lizardfolk warrior, embodying the pinnacle of their race’s physical prowess. They are both strong and agile, a perfect specimen of lizardfolk anatomy. Adorned in a simple loincloth, they wield a club studded with sharp shell fragments.

At the core of Semuanya’s philosophy lies the relentless pursuit of survival and propagation. They are beyond good and evil, law and chaos; they exists in a realm of pure amoral pragmatism. Their concern is not for the individual struggles of followers or the plights of other beings but for the fundamental continuance and proliferation of the species. Semuanya is both a mother and a father to the race; they represent both sides of the reproductive coin.

Semuanya’s indifference to the affairs of the planes stems from this singular focus on survival and propagation. They intervene only in dire circumstances that threaten the existence of lizardfolk on a massive scale. Their realm, a vast bog, is a reflection of this nature: primal, unadorned, and focused solely on the essentials of life.

While Semuanya has few interactions with other deities, they have an enemy in Sess’innek, a tanar’ri lord who seeks to dominate and corrupt lizardfolk. Despite Sess’innek’s intrusions, Semuanya remains largely unmoved, only compelled to act should the threat become significant enough to endanger their overarching goals.

Semuanya’s lizardfolk worshipers view their power as a guiding force for their race’s survival. Semuanya’s shamans, who also serve as healers and tribal leaders, emphasise isolation from other races and focus on the propagation of scalykind. They are typically reticent, reflecting their god’s nature, and value practical skills over theological doctrine.

Semuanya is a deity of raw survivalism, a figure who transcends moral and ethical concerns in favour of the most basic and powerful drive: the continuation of life. Their realm and actions are guided by this singular purpose, making them a unique and primal force in the Outlands.
