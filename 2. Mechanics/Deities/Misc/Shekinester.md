Let’s peel back the chant around Shekinester, the Queen of Nagas, and her thrice-twisted realm, eh? If you want to tumble to the dark of the Outlands movers and shakers, you’ve got to get to grips with this serpentine power. She ain’t like any other basher you’ve met in the Cage or beyond; she’s a trinity wrapped in magic and mystery, dealing in creation, destruction, wisdom, and preservation. She is both good and evil, law and chaos, and everything in between.

First off, we’ve got the **Weaver**, the crone-faced naga who’ll tear everything down just to build it up again. The Weaver is a spirit naga with a crystalline heart. She’s the end and the beginning, spinning the cosmos into being while unravelling the threads at the other end. Her loom ain’t just for show; it’s where destinies are woven tight, and let me tell you, the Weaver doesn’t suffer fools or their follies lightly.

Then there’s the **Empowerer**, a sight for sore eyes or a vision from your worst nightmare, depending on her mood. She’s the riddlemaster, the pusher of limits, doling out harsh truths like they’re going out of fashion. Cross her path, and you’re in for a trial by fire, or water, as it might be. She’s about making bashers face up to what they are, or could be, pushing ’em towards their own enlightenment—whether they’re looking for it or not. She can appear as a beautiful young water naga, or an ugly creature with pitted skin and greasy hair.

And last of all there’s the **Preserver**, the third piece of this enigmatic puzzle. She’s the keeper of the flame, the guardian of what mustn’t be lost. Her domain is the final circle, a place of knowledge so profound it would set your brainbox a-spinning. The Presever usually appears as a middle aged female guardian naga,

Shekinester might manifest as any of these three forms, or even more than one. They might work together or even against one another. And other times the trinity comes together as one gloriously confusing being. Better believe Shekinester is one of the most ancient and complex powers around, cutter.

### Relationships and History
Shekinester’s alliances are a motley assortment, from the Outlands’ oddities to the gods of the Egyptian pantheon. The Doomguard and Anarchists worship her Weaver aspect, while the Godsmen venerate the Empowerer and her punishing tests.
