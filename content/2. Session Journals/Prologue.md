### Summary

**Written by:** Azhari

It seemed like any other day, yet a sense of unease tugged at my senses as I set out for the spa. I was to meet a man rumored to hold the key to my quest. Everything was meticulously planned. Yet, as I walked, an overwhelming force besieged my mind—a relentless torment as if an invisible creature was ruthlessly digging through my brain and skull.

I was not alone in this strange, painful sensation. A jovial halfling, moments away from strumming her lute and spreading her chaotic cheer, joined me in retreat, abandoning her performance. Nearby, a kender, his pockets full of pilfered trinkets, fought against the urge to flee but eventually succumbed. In the shadows, a stern guard watched over the area, his gaze sharp, ever vigilant for any disorder, also not indifferent to that sensation. And an eerie, blue child, who would have remained invisible if not for that psychic ghost that haunted the 5 of us.

Driven by our shared torment, we fled through the winding streets until the refuge of an ancient, forsaken building loomed before us. Our minds grew more serene as we approached and entered it, but each step was heavy with the dread of what pursued us unseen.

As we settled into the eerie silence of the building, a sudden, soft voice broke the stillness. A cat, but not just any cat, but a talking one named Jisson. The thick air had the scent of old magic and there, on an otherwise regular table, layed an ancient tome, its cover embossed with the initials 'HL’. “That, my curious friends, is the source of your discomfort," Jisson said, his voice tinged with mischief. "It once belonged to Hieron Lifegiver, a wizard of formidable power. And I need your help to find him. In my previous life, I was an accountant, and Hieron entrusted this book to me to aid in my calculations. It served me well, but since my reincarnation into this plane as a cat, I’ve held onto it. Now, it’s time it was returned to its rightful owner." 

Our quest led us to question the locals and eventually, we were hinted to head towards a portal. A golden portal it was, and as we stepped through it, the bustling city of Ottamatta unfolded around us. What a horrid place! A city bound in grey, and every citizen moved in rhythm with the giant clock that towered over the city center, its ticks a constant, echoing presence in our ears. I often wondered if I had preferred the sharp pain that led me to this strange place in the first place. To make matters worse, paperwork seemed to govern every aspect of life here; permits, receipts, and forms fluttered from every hand, creating a bureaucratic labyrinth that was as daunting as any dungeon I have faced. The constant scratching of quills and shuffling of papers and that forsaking, relentless ticking, created a symphony of monotony that threatened to overwhelm my senses and sanity. Anyway, I am deviating.

As we finally gained entrance to the city, after what felt like an eternity of bureaucratic wrangling, we found ourselves adrift in its grey, orderly streets. Our aimless wandering brought us near "Tandel's Smoked Meat," that seemed to spark Jisson’s attention. I initially thought his reaction was solely to the scent of the smoked meats, but to my surprise, the book agreed with his intuition. Inside, the shop's owner was chopping meat with a rhythm that matched the ticking city outside. Upon mentioning the wizard we seeked, his knife paused mid-air, and his eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Hieron Lifegiver?" he muttered, then sighed, "Yes, I know him. He's been involved in some rather dubious dealings of late." He wiped his hands on his apron before leaning closer. "If you're looking for him, try The Divine Machine on street 17H. He's a regular there."

And so he was, but not anymore, for there we met Munscaal, an intense tiefling that told us the wizard has been hiding from criminals (and I suspect maybe the justice as well, but I am not one to judge, not yet at least). A strange hiding place he chose, if you ask me: "In a closet on the second floor of the Council of Order, in the storage room. Knock five times, then whistle this tune—just once."  confessed Munscaal. It did occur to me that we were being played the biggest prank of all times, but I was far too curious to know how all this would unfold. So following the sequence precisely, we knocked five times and whistled the tune. A door materialized, as if conjured by our actions. There, nestled among forgotten files and dusty law books, was Hieron Lifegiver.

Our mission seemed accomplished, and I had wasted far too much time already, so I was ready to head back to my own businesses, when an elf, accompanied by a group of menacing thugs, burst through the door. Their intentions were clear—they wanted Hieron. With danger pressing in from all sides, we found unity in our shared peril. Weapons drawn and spells at the ready, we stood together, a newly forged team bound by the need to protect one of our own. And so we fought, and won, and now I wonder where this new strange turn of events and relations will lead me.
