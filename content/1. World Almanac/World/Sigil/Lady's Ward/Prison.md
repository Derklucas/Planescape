A single grim blemish of gray stone and metal rises above Sigil's resplendent courthouses. Headquarters of the Mercykillers, the Prison is a warning to wrongdoers of the full penalty of law. The Prison's architecture is anathema to hope and light. During the dark and twilight hours, glaring searchlights affixed to the penitentiary's barbed watchtowers scan the ward below for runaways, but all that escapes its walls are the wails of the prisoners within.

**Cells**. Engineered to contain all manner of planar convicts, the Prison's cells vary by block. Fire elementals and arsonists are sealed in frigid cells, while giants are issued with magic collars that sap their might and reduce them to diminutive statures. Grudges fester in bleak cells, and fights regularly break out between inmates in mess halls and common areas.

Particularly dangerous criminals never leave their cells, which are suspended in high-security units that hang from the Prison's exterior like inverted buttresses. Map 2.3 depicts a section of the Prison that houses one such criminal, the infamous portal saboteur known as the Grixitt (neutral, human spy).

**Cellars**. Mercykillers torment rebellious inmates in the Cellars, the Prison's dark undercroft. Desperate scratches mar the dungeon's blood-red chambers, where prisoners are dragged to but sometimes never return. When an inmate proves especially resilient or dangerous, the Mercykillers banish them to the Hole, a cylindrical cell block of isolated demiplanes suffused with antimagic.

**Prison Inmates**. Notorious criminals, interplanar outlaws, cosmic warlords, and other threats to the multiverse are incarcerated in the Prison. Examples of inmates appear in the Prison Inmates table.

**Wardens.** Sigil is a big city, and the wheels of justice turn slowly. Factol Nilesia employs a number of wardens to keep prisoners in check. Creatures in the Prison might encounter any of the following wardens:

- **Allarind the Thin**, a sadistic adult blue dracolich who died in the Prison long ago.
- **Buel**, a stoic warden archon (see Morte's Planar Parade) who has thwarted countless jailbreaks.
- **Gazzengar**, a calculating, neutral mind flayer who isn't afraid to crack a few skulls to keep inmates in line.
- **Olmulloz**, a pasty shator demodand (see Morte's Planar Parade) accompanied by a pack of rabid hell hounds.
