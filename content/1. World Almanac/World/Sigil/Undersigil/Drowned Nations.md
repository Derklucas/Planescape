Sigil's sewers converge on the Drowned Nations, a flooded expanse of rank, lukewarm reservoirs and the swampy tunnels that connect them. An enormous drain linked to the Elemental Plane of Water rests in the turbid depths. It's perpetually clogged with some amount of planar refuse, but sewage rarely backs up enough to flood well-to-do wards.

Kuo-toa, troglodytes, and other aquatic folk live in the Drowned Nations, as do land dwellers who navigate the sewers by boat. Denizens of the Plane of Water don't take kindly to Sigil polluting their home. Grat the Glass-Jawed, a sahuagin baron whose gums are jammed with sharpened gems, periodically surfaces to skewer Undersigil's residents from the back of his mutated shark, Ripper (a hunter shark with a walking speed of 30 feet). Others, like the aboleth Abadoom, carve out lairs in the pungent meres. Ancient and unknowing, Abadoom harbors some of Sigil's darkest secrets.
