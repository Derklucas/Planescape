Raucous, booze-fueled brawls take place in the back room of the Bottle and Jug, one of the Hive's most infamous drinkeries. This mass of steel, barbed wire, and black granite is owned by Beatrice Bazlan, a flightless [[Erinyes]] who won the joint but lost her wings in a high-stakes match against its previous owner and his two trolls. Beatrice is tough as nails and loves a good laugh at someone else's expense. Anyone's welcome in her taproom.

A portal to a massive pit-fighting arena rests at the back of the Bottle and Jug, disguised as the door to an always-out-of-order lavatory for big and tall creatures. Gabel, a retired pit fiend judge, guards the entrance, but most entrants respectfully call him "Your Honor." On the other side of the door lies a bloodstained amphitheater where spectators place bets and combatants test their mettle. The current heavyweight champion is a bloodthirsty cyclops named Akra.

In addition to the typical variety of cheap swill peddled throughout the Hive, Beatrice keeps a selection of top-shelf liquors in a chilled demiplane behind the bar for scoundrels with coin to spare:

##### Menu
- **Annam's Blood.** Barreled on Ysgard, this crimson mead swirls with scenes of battle. A war cry bellows from the tap when a mug of Annam's Blood is poured.
- **Chaos Frog.** This distilled spirit constantly shifts in color. Made from a plant harvested on Limbo, each bottle contains a dead slaad tadpole.
- **Eight Squared.** This small-batch, amber hooch comes in a rectangular bottle with a tiny cog for a cap. When placed on a flat surface, the cap rotates like the gears of Mechanus.
- **Golden Gout.** Imported from the Nine Hells, this spiced whiskey burns all the way down. Imbibers often belch a small flame after taking a shot.
- **Swamp Water.** Bottled locally by a green hag with six teeth and an infectious laugh, this murky, sour gin causes the drinker to break out in a harmless rash of purple warts that vanish within minutes.
