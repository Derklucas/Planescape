The Bleak Cabal's headquarters is the Gatehouse, a fortress of rehabilitation and renewal. The tiered, ivory sanctuary rests on a hill at the end of Bedlam Run, a curved road that rises to meet the headquarters above the Hive. Calming fountains cascade over its chalk-white balconies, which radiate from its central tower. The Gatehouse specializes in treating planar afflictions. Inside, Bleakers tend to those harmed by the planes and by the creatures that inhabit them.

#### House of Rehabilitation

Members of the Bleak Cabal find solace in existence by relieving the burdens of others. Bleakers in the Gatehouse restore creatures warped by demon ichor, research and remove complex curses, and comfort those who have glimpsed otherworldly horrors of sinister realms.

Althax Darkfleece, serves as the Gatehouse's resident expert on the negative effects of planar magic. Hailing from the gate-town of Bedlam, Althax is a wise and compassionate academic who keeps unreasonable hours. To aid her ongoing research, she occasionally hires adventurers to investigate locations suffused with planar magicâ€”or collect samples from the planes themselves.
