The Transcendent Order's headquarters is the Great Gymnasium, a temple to body, mind, and spirit, hewed from marble and veined with gold. In addition to exercise fields and gymnastic equipment, the Great Gymnasium's luxurious halls hold bountiful comforts: lemon-scented baths, refreshing saunas, and meditation rooms perfumed with rose. The facility is designed to eliminate distractions, promote mindfulness, and encourage self-improvement.

The Great Gymnasium is a mental and spiritual oasis, a place of peace and safety where occupants can forget their burdens. Visitors must surrender their weapons before entering the gymnasium, and spellcasting is allowed only in sanctioned areas. Sigil's factions regard the Great Gymnasium as neutral ground, and numerous treaties have been penned within.

**Training Grounds.** The gymnasium's training grounds welcome visitors to hone their strength, agility, and coordination. There, Factol Rhys conducts regular training sessions, where she pushes her students to the limit. Calm but fierce, she regularly spars with Transcendent Order members, encouraging them to act without thinking.
