Forked chrome spires hum atop the Planar Energy Cooperative, a cylindrical tower isolated from the commerce of the ward. Founded by a circle of archmages whose home worlds succumbed to destructive magic, the fortress serves as a seismograph for magical activity. Inside, mages monitor the flow of magic throughout the multiverse on an array of planar orreries, scanning them for arcane anomaliesâ€”hotspots, dead zones, and areas teeming with antimagic. The collective seeks to maintain a steady flow of magic across the cosmos and concentrate or divert it when necessary to ensure the survival of worlds.

In times of great planar unrest, the members of the Planar Energy Cooperative can combine their powers to siphon magic from entire worlds to dampen dangerous artifacts or prevent malicious spellcasters from unleashing catastrophic magic. Despite their influence, the mages are few, and their efforts require them to maintain intense concentration in the cooperative. As a result, they often assign worthy adventurers to deal with threats at their sources.
