![[Civic Festhall Banner.png|banner]]Creativity blossoms in the Civic Festhall, the headquarters of the Society of Sensation. Sensates spared no expense constructing this majestic building, which reaches nearly one thousand feet in height. Visitors find all manner of sensory delights within: gastronomic masterpieces served by innovative chefs; halls lined with fragrant, scratch-and-sniff statuaries; and pitch-black deprivation chambers bathed in supernatural silence.

##### Artistic Amenities
The Civic Festhall boasts a panoply of arts available to the public. Galleries, concert and lecture halls, museums, and exhibits too eccentric to describe fill the festhall and its satellite buildings. Contests and duels are held at the Northumber, an outdoor amphitheater, while magical light checkers the stages of its two indoor theaters: the intimate Elloweth Theater and the prodigious Ren Hall. Elloweth Theater is renowned as Sigil's preeminent venue for high-brow performance art, and performers from across the Great Wheel flock to Elloweth Theater to take their shot at interplanar fame.

##### Sensoriums
The most popular offerings in the Civic Festhall are the Sensoriums, semiprivate rooms where creatures can record and relive one another's sensory experiences through sensory stones. For a price of 10 gp, a client can feel the thrill of a researcher's epiphany, the weight of a widow's grief, or the warm bite of a flaky pastry. Memories and longer, more complex sensations tend to cost more, but the lure of nostalgia draws repeat customers.

The Society of Sensation pays well for sensations not contained in its extensive collection. Sensates reward adventurers for delivering sensory stones that contain coveted yet dangerous experiences, such as the thrill of stealing a coin from a sleeping dragon's hoard. Rumors say the sensates also keep a collection of sensory stones containing unspeakable insights and experiences disruptive to multiversal peace. Sensates sequester these and other restricted sensations in a demiplanar sanctum accessible only to trusted members.
