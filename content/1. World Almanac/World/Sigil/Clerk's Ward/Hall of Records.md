Once a thriving college, the Hall of Records was foreclosed on for a slightly overdue debt to the Fated centuries ago. The Fated has since repurposed the building as its headquarters. The campus consists of six stately towers—originally seven, but the library was sold and walled off—and a sprawling network of underground archives linked to each of the academy's founding structures.

**Records.** Inside the guarded complex, members of the Fated conduct all manner of documentation. Clerks file property deeds, issue birth and death certificates, and maintain extensive financial records, while scriveners meticulously prepare official proclamations for posting.

In theory, anyone in Sigil with proper approval can request a specific document or wade through the hall's dusty stacks, but the process is mired in bureaucratic entanglements. More often, a bribe can accomplish as much in half the time, and hefty sums can convince a Taker to lose or even alter a document in the Hall of Records.

**Vaults.** Valuable tomes are stored in vaults beneath the campus, including The Secret History of Sigil, a detailed account of the Fated's activities and the secrets its agents have learned. Volumes of this ongoing research project, especially recent ones, fetch a high price with opposing factions.

Unsurprisingly, the underground compound is heavily defended. Within the campus lies a thrumming portal to Ysgard, a plane where might makes right and the Takers hoard their spoils. Giants stomp out of the portal to squash intruders in the name of the Fated, causing books and scrolls to quake in their lumbering wake.
