Along the banks of the Ditch, a fire-gutted building conceals a gaping hole into the ground with a single ladder leading down into darkness. Here lies the Bones of the Night, a cavern complex home to the Master of Bones: [[Lothar the Old]]. From the catacombs of Undersigil, Lothar gathers a macabre collection of skulls from various creatures, organizing them into a library of sorts. Ossuaries riddle the walls of his bizarre exhibit, their ledges richly decorated with grave goods paid to the departed.

The Master of Bones uses necromancy to commune with the skulls in his collection and draw on their shared knowledge. For a fee, Lothar can cast the speak with dead spell on any of his skulls, asking questions on the clients' behalf. He also trades and purchases new skulls. His prices range from 1 gp for a person who knew a single valuable story to upward of 10,000 gp for the skull of a factol or the high priest of a dead god.

The library is well guarded. Lothar is a capable combatant in his own right and can animate a host of skulls in his collection as flameskulls. To combat larger threats, the Master of Bones relies on a ghoul-shaped stone golem that answers to his command.
