The Ubiquitous Wayfarer is a reputable three-story tavern whose taproom contains over two dozen portals to other parts of Sigil and beyond. The tavern sits in the Lower Ward, but some folks believe it's in whatever ward they happen to live in. The Wayfarer is popular among planar explorers and adventurers who use its portals to get around the city. It offers a quick path across the city if one knows the right portals, though its proprietor, a gray-haired bartender named [[Riaen Blackhome]] takes exception to people using her place as a shortcut without stopping for a drink.
