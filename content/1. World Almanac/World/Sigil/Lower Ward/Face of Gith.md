Patrons drink silently in the Face of Gith, a gloomy tavern frequented by githzerai. A faded, dispassionate githzerai face marks the establishment, a smooth, oblong building shaped from a slab of adamantine. Although anyone is allowed into the bar, patrons and proprietor alike are skeptical of outsiders and willing to draw steel to keep their space safe.

The tavern's interior is subdued and dim. There are no rowdy drinking songs, and most conversations take place telepathically or in hushed tones. In the center of the main room hovers an amorphous blob of primordial chaos that shifts erratically. Taken from the roiling plane of Limbo, the glob endlessly changes from stone to fire, freezes into a fractalized diamond, melts into swirling clouds that smell strongly of lavender, and so on. Some psychic regulars exert their mental will over the chaotic glob, shaping it into objects, creatures, or sensory phenomena for the amusement of other patrons. Rumor has it that the blob can be shaped into a portal to Limbo but that the key constantly changes.

Ezmerath owns and runs the Face of Gith. They have a good relationship with the Athar and are happy to call in a favor if anyone, especially god worshipers, disrupt their tavern. Ezmerath is also a secret member of the Sha'sal Khou, a faction of githyanki and githzerai who wish to unite their fractured people.
