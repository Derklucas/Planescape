The thrumming heart of industry in Sigil, the Great Foundry is the headquarters of the Mind's Eye. The foundry's a sprawling complex of workshops, warehouses, storage yards, and furnaces. Seekers work it tirelessly. By day, the foundry obscures the sky with smoke and steam, and by night, it illuminates entire city blocks with roaring fires.

The Mind's Eye makes many of the tools and metalcrafts used throughout Sigil. The foundry's most talented smiths are magical sculptors who require neither coal nor flame. They fashion strong yet delicate objects from minimal materials, shaping an ounce of ore into a lightweight yet trustworthy tool with a wave of their palms.

**Gates**. The Great Foundry's two wrought-iron main gates are as tall as the neighboring buildings. The intimidating guards minding the gates embellish their armor with iron spikes and jagged decoration scavenged from the foundry's scraps. Ogres, giants, and reformed devils in the Mind's Eye, they prevent the tools of creation from falling into the hands of destructive forces. Beyond lies the main yard, a sooty, gravel expanse heaped with piles of rubble and raw ore.

**Mithral Tower.** At the center of the Great Foundry is the Mithral Tower, a metalworks that stands over ten stories tall. Huge, iron-barred windows flood its interior with light, and enormous doors allow wagons full of ore to roll right in. It's unbearably hot, and the din of spouting furnaces and ringing anvils makes conversation difficult. Fiery-mouthed furnaces the size of barns yawn in every direction, and crucibles large enough to hold a fire giant brim with molten metal.
