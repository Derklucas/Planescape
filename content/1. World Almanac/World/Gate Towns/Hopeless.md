Aptly named, Hopeless is a dreary town with but one entrance: the Screaming Gate, a garish archway of red stone carved in the shape of a howling face. Crimson streaks of chipping paint run from its wide, empty eyes like pained tears on either side of an elongated mouth. It's the only pop of color in the somber town, a spiral of weathered gray buildings in a pit under a perpetually overcast sky.
