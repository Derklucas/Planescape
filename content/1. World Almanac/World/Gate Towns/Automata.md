**Gate Destination:** Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus
**Primary Citizens:** Modrons
**Rulers:** Council of Order
**Population:** 10,000

Automata is a machine of law and order. The town's geography is as rigid as its bureaucracy, its buildings meticulously maintained and erected with mathematical precision. The gate-town's right-angled, nearly identical establishments flummox visitors, but the friendly modron residents that make up the bulk of its population navigate the "intuitive" grid of numbered streets with ease.

Automata obeys a strict hierarchy of law overseen by the Council of Order, a triumvirate of officials representing three fulcrums of society. Every major decision is subject to the council's scrutiny, but not before running a bureaucratic gauntlet of forms and minor approvals to earn its coveted final stamp. The Council of Order has the following members:

- **Aristimus**, captain of the town guard.
- **Juliett-314**, oversees local commerce and acts as Automata's supreme auditor
- **Serafil**, speaks on behalf of the gate-town's temples.

Beneath Automata's polished streets, citizens escape the rule of law. Criminals, fugitives, and disgruntled townsfolk conduct their business in the gate-town's vibrant underground, the Inverse, free from the gate-town's endless regulations but not from authority altogether. A fractious trio of lawful evil decaton modrons, the Council of Anarchy, presides over the Inverse and administers its own twisted brand of justice.
