A hub of ethical trade, the gate-town to Bytopia brings a slice of Sigil's sprawling markets to the Outer Planes without the breakneck pace or cutthroat competition of that multiversal hub. Tradegate is a town of industrious laborers and gentle traders, buzzy plazas and quaint boutiques, and quiet crafts and wild inventions.

Tradegate's citizens are upright, productive, and optimistic. Dwarves and gnomes abound in the star-shaped town, acting as builders, merchants, and tinkerers who aren't strangers to the daily grind. Under the guidance of the Five Star Guild—a council of entrepreneurs, innovators, and representatives from the town mint—Tradegate has risen to a mercantile powerhouse at the center of the Great Wheel.

Coinage from across the multiverse flows through Tradegate. The gate-town simplifies market exchanges by minting its own currency, a magnetic cobalt coin known as a lodestar. The lodestar has become a standard currency accepted in transactions throughout the Outlands. However, the currency isn't as stable as its prevalence suggests.

Due to its reputation for economic prosperity, Tradegate has become the target of raids, the worst of which is a recurring group of treasure-hungry xorn. Periodically, the voracious Elementals surface in the town, destroying buildings and devouring the town's plentiful reserves. Nevertheless, Tradegate's stouthearted folk remain undeterred, hastily rebuilding demolished businesses.
