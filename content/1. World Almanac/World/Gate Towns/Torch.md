Torch is a den of thieves built on the slopes of three volcanic spires that rise from a blood-red marsh. Formed from hardened molten rock, the pillars alternate in spewing blazing streams of pyrophoric gas, providing light and heat to the town.

Clustered buildings retreat from the pestilent swamp, climbing each spire to its steep, walled-off heights. Notorious kingpins, brazen embezzlers, and brooding criminal masterminds look down on petty larcenists from their towering hideouts, but danger still looms even for those at the top. Without warning, the hollow peaks erupt with sporadic jets of lava and flaming rockslides, or as the locals say, "trouble above, trouble below."

The people of Torch are crooked, greedy, and cruel. Townsfolk eye each other with suspicion as they pass through the sloped alleys, clutching their purses in one hand and brandishing cautionary blades in the other. Grifters, bullies, and bandits serve as minions for Torch's numerous criminal syndicates, seedy organizations preoccupied with robbing each other and destroying rival guilds.

The gate-town is controlled by the Family, a tenebrous inner circle of crime bosses who enforce some semblance of honor among the thieves of Torch. Admission into the Family is by invite only. The full roster of members is shrouded in secrecy, as are the venues for their conclaves. Even so, some names in Torch carry more weight than others, and locals can't help but speculate about such folk's involvement in the town's hidden oligarchy.
