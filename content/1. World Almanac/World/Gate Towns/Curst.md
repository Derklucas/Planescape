Curst is a menagerie of exiles and outcasts. Fugitives, traitors, and runaways trade one punishment for another in the poisonous town, a dismal burg chained to the prison plane of Carceri. Betrayers and backstabbers ruminate on their pasts in captivity, agonizing over their mistakes or counting down the days until they can exact vengeance on those who wronged them. Cracked, dried-up soil pervades the town and its rusted structures, rising as clouds of dust with every step.

The maelephants of the Wall Watch patrol Curst's perimeter: a high, corroded barrier lined with saw-toothed barbs and search towers. The elephantine warders turn their gaze inward, ensuring no one escapes. Curst receives traitors and felonious folk with open arms, but to leave the gate-town, residents must receive approval from the burgomaster, a capricious [[Shator Demodand]] named Villigus Bazengar. Susceptible to cajolery, the ruthless demodand has been known to spare those who stroke his insufferable ego.

When authorities from other gate-towns come knocking on their doors, residents feign ignorance or offer up false clues to throw off the nose of justice. Residents remain smugly aloof, fending off bounty hunters like bad suitors. Beneath their placid veneer, however, some prisoners seek to cause ruin and strife, such as the conniving burgomaster, who shelters secrets of his own. Others just want to be left alone.

### Gate
The gate to Carceri stands in a ringed courtyard in the center of town. The ruddy, four-pillared metal arch swirls with carmine sand and tortured cries. Creatures that step into the reddish squall emerge in Orthys, the torrid first layer of Carceri. Locals believe the gate is a one-way portal because no one recalls ever witnessing anything crawl out of it. The gate has no guards, as the gate's reputation is enough of a deterrent.

### Second Exile
Crimes from a previous life are forgotten in Curst, and citizens rarely inquire about one another's pasts. Such information is either volunteered willingly or loudly proclaimed by officials scouring the town for renegades. However, those who commit crimes within Curst risk a fate called Second Exile, in which the offender is bound and thrown into the gate, never to return. Second Exile is typically reserved for gruesome or otherwise unforgivable acts, and the burgomaster alone decides which transgressions warrant the sentence.

### Regional Effects
The region containing Curst's planar gate is influenced by the magic of Carceri, creating one or more of the following effects in and around the gate-town:

- **Ball and Chain.** Creatures in Curst feel as though they're dragging a ball and chain behind themselves and have their speed reduced by 5 feet.
- **Extradimensional Prison**. Creatures can't leave Curst using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means other than the town's gate to Carceri. Any attempt to do so is wasted.

As an action, the burgomaster can suppress either of these effects for any number of creatures of the burgomaster's choice for 1 hour.

### Noteworthy Sites
Curst is separated into six districts by five circular roads. Like ripples in a pond, they radiate from the gate to Carceri, each ring confining the last. Buildings in Curst are makeshift structures cobbled together from tarnished metal and weathered stone. Light ekes through glass windows, clouded and spiderwebbed with cracks, illuminating charmless abodes honeycombed with glorified prison cells.

#### Burgomaster's Estate
The burgomaster's residence is a chamber of horrors dedicated to chastisement and correction. From the outside, the three-story manor looks like an elaborate, menacing cage. A reddish glow emanates from a pair of slanted windows above its spiked veranda, giving it the impression of a grimacing face. The estate's heavy doors screech on their hinges, and farastu demodands (see Morte's Planar Parade) creep along its iron-barred balusters.
