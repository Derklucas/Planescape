Bram’s Folly, the boggy joke of the Outlands, is a tale of getting lemons and making, well, not lemonade, but somethin’ just as good. Bram, an earth mephit with more savvy than many a Cager tout, got peeled when buying some land and found himself the owner of what most berks would call a soddin’ mess. He was told that he was getting the best land that money could buy, tall pines, rugged hills, and untapped mineral wealth. In reality Bram was sold an apparently useless stretch of muddy marshes, tar pits, and hard packed flat land with trees more sparse than a modron’s sense of humor.
