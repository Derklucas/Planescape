## Description

The Harmonium looks at existence and sees only two states: war and peace. Where neighbors share the same views, there's peace—the perfect state of the multiverse—but disagreements breed conflict and instability. Members of the Harmonium believe their purpose is to unify the multiverse into peace, no matter the cost. 

The Harmonium seeks to eliminate discord by any means necessary. Hardheads use education and enforcement to convert others to their philosophy, extolling the virtues of peace as they crack down on chaos in all its forms. 

Many members are good-natured protectors who protect all citizens, even those who disagree with the faction's philosophy. However, some among the ranks pursue unity at any cost. Cruel martinets who earn the Hardheads their nickname, they enforce laws ruthlessly, without flexibility or compassion. 

Factol Sarin commands the Harmonium. His devotion to his fellows, particularly new recruits, is renowned, and he takes a personal interest in all members who cross his path. Tough as steel, Sarin is a decisive factol who promotes honor, dignity, and peace in word and deed.
