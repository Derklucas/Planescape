## Description

The Hands of Havoc are a controlled burn. A collection of radical individualists united under the banner of change, they set fire to outdated and oppressive institutions, letting the ashes pave the way for something new. 

Wreakers vehemently oppose rigid laws, especially those that serve bureaucracies more than they do people. The Hands of Havoc convene in secret and mobilize as oneâ€”a wildfire that burns away crumbling structures and systems alike to create sanctuaries for those in need. 

No one individual leads the Hands of Havoc. To confuse enforcers, the mantle of factol is passed between members. Whenever it seems the faction's leader is on the verge of arrest or death, another nonconformist rises from the ranks to light the path forward. 

The Hands of Havoc are champions of freedom and self-expression. Wreaker artists decorate bland buildings and forlorn structures throughout Sigil with bold murals in avant-garde styles. The passion of their ideology fuels artistic innovation, sparking trends in writing, music, and dance that spread throughout the city.
