## Description

The Mercykillers believe that cold, relentless justice is absolute and that no one is above it. To the Jailers, a perfect multiverse is one purged of injustice. 

Mercykillers earned their name for their ruthlessness. They've killed their own mercy, viewing it as an exploitable weakness. Criminals may beg as they please, but their sentences are carried out with unshakable fervor. 

Jailers don't make laws or pass judgment. Similarly, they don't arrest lawbreakersâ€”that's the Harmonium's job. Mercykillers act only after a verdict has been made, administering punishment without leniency. Members believe they answer to a higher cosmic law that absolves them of any wrongdoing during their unabating pursuit of justice. 

Factol Alisohn Nilesia, a young and cunning leader raised in Sigil's penitentiary, was born to head the Mercykillers. She's a strict warden, using divination magic to track down fugitives and deploy agents to retrieve them. Somehow, she finds time to personally sign off on every punishment in the Cage. Mercykillers whisper that justice never sleeps, and neither does Nilesia.
