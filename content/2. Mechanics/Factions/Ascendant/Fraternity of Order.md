## Description

The Fraternity of Order examines existence through the lens of three tenets: laws are representations of power, knowledge is power, and knowledge of law is the ultimate power. By understanding those laws, individuals can exploit them—or break them under the right circumstances. 

According to the Guvners, there are three types of regulations. The lowest of these are Rules, the laws that govern people's behavior. Next come Laws, such as the laws of nature or the edicts of gods. Ultimate authority descends from Axioms, overarching laws that govern existence and give gods their immense power. Guvners theorize about Axioms but know few of them. A being who masters all Axioms can rule the multiverse. 

Factol Hashkar is the highest authority in Sigil's court system, though he casts verdicts in only the most important cases. Hashkar is as long winded as he is knowledgeable, and any inquiry sparks an impromptu lecture. Outside legal matters, the factol splits his time between learning and lecturing. He has mastered at least one Axiom, from which he derives his magical abilities.
