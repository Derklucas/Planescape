## Description

To the Bleak Cabal, the quest for cosmic meaning is futileâ€”the multiverse doesn't make sense, and it isn't supposed to. With no greater truth, individuals must derive their own meaning from the multiverse. This introspection kindles empathy and kindness in many Bleakers, who commit themselves to easing the suffering of others. Existence is merciless, so the Bleak Cabal must show mercy in its stead. 

Bleakers tend to those overcome by the strange realities of the Outer Planes, which exert their influence on travelers who wander past their boundaries. The Bleak Cabal rehabilitates creatures that have been stricken with planar curses, glimpsed mind-shattering expanses, or ventured into the howling darkness of Pandemonium. 

Factol Lhar surveys the citizens of Sigil with growing concern. Lhar works to expand the Bleak Cabal's charitable influence. Under his direction, the Bleak Cabal has opened community kitchens throughout the city where hungry citizens can get a free hot meal. However, some factions don't view this expansion as benevolent. Lhar moves carefully, always looking for like-minded individuals to further his cause.
