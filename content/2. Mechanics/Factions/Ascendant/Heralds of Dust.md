## Description

The Heralds of Dust believe the multiverse itself is an afterlife—a shadow of some other existence now gone—and every creature is already dead. The "life" that beings cling to is simply the first stage of death. 

Dusters seek to understand and experience the stages of death, the last of which they hold is True Death: a transcendence to a state of being beyond the multiverse. In their quest for True Death, the Heralds of Dust slowly set aside the hope and passion that chain a soul to this false life. 

The Heralds of Dust have a macabre fascination with Undead. They believe undeath is a precursor to True Death and count many Undead among their ranks. Skeletons and zombies serve the faction in droves, and sapient Undead—such as ghosts, vampires, and liches—rise to factotums. 

Factol Skall is the oldest factol in Sigil. The founder of the Heralds of Dust, Skall has yet to transcend his current existence, lingering to guide as many souls as possible along the path to True Death. Skall strives to know everything and feel nothing. He makes generous use of adventurers to gather knowledge or help lay the dead to rest with dignity.
