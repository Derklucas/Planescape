Nycaloths, also known as nycadaemons, nycademons, and sky demons, were the elite air cavalry in yugoloth armies, swooping down onto enemy flanks and tearing up unsuspecting troops. They were the lowest of the greater yugoloths and bitterly resented it, constantly scheming to ascend to greater status and prestige.
