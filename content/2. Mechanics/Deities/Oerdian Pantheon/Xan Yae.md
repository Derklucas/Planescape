Xan Yae is the gentle goddess of moderation and balance who seeks to avoid extremes, teaching that happiness is found inside once balance is achieved. Mystic power flows naturally from this balance. She is seen as a perfectionist and a harsh teacher. Her cult is very small and elite. Psychics and monks use her as a model in their meditations.  
  
Xan Yae is the Baklunish goddess of Twilight, Shadows, Stealth, and Mental Power. Xan Yae is an ascended mortal sponsored by Istus.

### Worship
Xan Yae, the Perfect Mistress has some measure of popularity among rogues and monks, thieves and less savory sorts, young lovers, and those of cautious nature. Xan Yae's worshippers seek out dungeons and labyrinths full of hidden lore

#### Vestments
Xan Yae's clerics wear cloaks of gray and typically carry falchions or those weapons associated with monks.

#### Temples
Because she teaches mastery of the unseen, Xan Yae's temples and monasteries are usually very hard to find, typically in secluded settings. In urban areas they tend to be large but disguised as some other form of building.

### Dogma
Reality depends upon three metaphysical ideals: the Universal Mind (the universe and all things in it exist because the mind created them and maintain them), the Perpetual Harmony (life is balanced, symmetry is in all things, achieving a similar state puts one in harmony with nature), and Internal Peace (martial and mental activities must be mastered to attain a higher level of existence). Flamboyance and wasted energy have no place in the Lady's realm. The extremes of evil and good must be sought out and tempered with harmony to maintain balance.

### Appearance and manifestations
Xan Yae appears as a Baklunish human of any age or sex, slender and graceful, wielding a pair of magical falchions that she can shrink to easily conceal. She is usually dressed in cloth of dove gray, dusty rose, or golden orange.

### Relationships and History
Xan Yae was served by the demigod, Zuoken, before he vanished. She is a close ally of the Cat Lord, Rexfelis, and opposes Pholtus and Pyremius. She is also allied with Kurell.
