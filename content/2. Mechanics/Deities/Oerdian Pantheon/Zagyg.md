Zagyg’s a tricky one to pin down, see. He’s as changeable as the planes themselves. Sometimes you can find him decked out in dark blue and silver, other times he’s a short, heavyset human with a face as round and flushed as a ripe tomato. But he relishes magic to change his appearance and fool cutters. His symbol? The rune of insanity – two zig-zag lines that look like they’ve had a few too many at the Styx Oarsman.

This berk’s all about the laugh, the unexpected twist, the bit of whimsy that leaves you gobsmacked. He believes everyone deserves a good giggle, a surprise that keeps ’em guessing long after the joke’s been played. And let’s not forget his obsession with occult lore—the weirder and more arcane, the better. He’s a seeker, wielder and creator of truly wondrous items, even artefacts.

### Worship
The various small clusters of his faith focus on one type of humor for a time, then abandon it when they believe it perfected, only to take it up again after a seemingly random interval. Zagyg's few clerics enjoy bringing strangeness and humor to the lives of those around them, especially those in need of comedy to lift up their dulled souls. Many work as bards, travel far when their jokes are misunderstood or cause offense, and try to uncover lost magical knowledge. Most have at least one odd personal quirk, although whether this is an actual trait or one affected solely for the observer is debatable.

#### Vestments
Like their deity, clerics favor dark blue and silver, but are inconsistent in their wardrobe.

#### Temples
One of Zagyg's few temples, the _House of Zagyg_, is a bizarre edifice with slanted, windowless walls, a skewed door, and an eccentric color scheme - purple, yellow, red, and pink. The floor is angled as well, the legs of the furniture cut to compensate. The temple is run by Abbot Kormath Burrsten; there were two other abbots, but they are "on sabbatical."

### Dogma
All deserve and need to be entertained and surprised by humor, although preferably in a manner that leaves them wondering for some time; to provide this service is of the highest priority. The quest for odd bits of information on magic is of utmost importance, and above all one should live a life of unpredictability and abstain from repetitive habits.

### Appearance and manifestations
Zagyg's appearance varies, though he is usually garbed in blue and silver. He is likely to appear with a vorpal sword in one hand and a wand of wonder in the other. Cursed items that he wears tend to affect his opponents rather than himself. As a mortal, Zagyg was a short, heavyset human with round, often flushed, face.

### Relationships and History
Zagyg is a servant of [[Boccob]]. Many of those that Zagyg imprisoned (including Fraz-Urb'luu, Merikka, Iuz, Rudd, Wastri, and Zuoken) feel anything from opposition to utter hatred toward him. Although Olidammara retains no hard feelings over the episode, appreciating the wit the Mad Arch-Mage showed in their duel.  
  
As the founder of the Company of Seven, Zagyg is a former adventuring comrade of Heward, Keoghtom, Murlynd, Nolzur, Quaal, and Tasha. He was, for a time, apprenticed to Lyzandred. He is kin to Heward and Mordenkainen and the adoptive father of Yrag the Lord. He is also on good terms with Celestian.  
  
Zagyg is also the founder of the Ring of Five, though this alliance seems to have broken up in recent years. Zagyg can be found visiting or exploring with Keoghtom and Murlynd, with Keoghtom, Murlynd, and Mordenkainen, with Keoghtom and Mordenkainen, with Keoghtom and Heward, or with Celestian and Keoghtom.
