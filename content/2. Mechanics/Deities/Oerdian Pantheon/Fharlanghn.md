Fharlanghn is the god of travel and distance. While his younger brother Célestian strolls among the stars, this tireless traveler prefers to travel the four corners of the world. He is a well-known deity on the world of Oerth and it is said that he wanders that world in person.  
  
Fharlanghn reigns on the roads and offers security, good fortune and favorable weather to travelers who pray. As such, he is also considered by many to be the god of quests that require a long journey.

### Worship
Fharlanghn is the patron of all those who travel long distances, whether on the surface or in the depths of the Underdark. His symbol is often seen in inns and stables across the continent of Oerik (the largest continent on Oerth). His followers include adventurers, merchants, vagabonds and travelers of all sorts.

#### Hierarchy
Due to the church's interest in traveling and adventuring, advancement within the church occurs by gaining experience or conversion of followers during one's travels. Titles, from low-ranking to high, include: _Journeyman_, _Quester_, _Worlder_, _High Worlder_. A Worlder must have traveled at least 10,000 miles on foot or mount. A High Worlder must have traveled at least 50,000 miles, with at least 10,000 of that at sea.  
  
Matters of faith and doctrine are reached at rare and brief councils of the High Worlders (high-ranking priests), convened at Zhanehmish. The most traveled High Worlder wields the greatest influence over the calling of such councils and the resulting rulings, but all High Worlders who attend theoretically have an equal voice in the process.

#### Vestments
Clerics tend to have their vestments constructed of durable material well suited to traveling. The Journeymen are particularly choosy regarding their boots or shoes, as they must be comfortable on long, walking treks. Traveling clerics tend to wear green robes, while those managing the temples wear brown. The temple colors are yellow, black and silver. Fharlanghn's favored weapon is the quarterstaff.

#### Temples
The cult has never sought to erect a large temple to the glory of Fharlanghn because every road, path, country lane, are all testimonies of his majesty.  
  
Roadside shrines and sanctuaries to Fharlanghn can be found throughout the world, so that the faithful can pay homage to him without having to turn from their path. His symbol is often visible in the inns and stables that line the roads of Flannesse. Many cities, villages, and towns, including Greyhawk, have churches to the Dweller on the Horizon. Every road and trail is sacred to him, and instead of traveling to specific destinations, wandering itself is a sacrament for Fharlanghn's pilgrims.

### Dogma
You have to travel and discover new things. Always be ready to go, because the world can change overnight and you may suddenly need a new home or new perspectives. To find inspiration, turn to the horizon; the end of the world is home to new peoples, new cultures, new enchantments and new routes to take. Any road, street or path is a precious gift from Fharlanghn.  
  
Open-mindedness is key. When you go from one place to another, you have to be open to all lifestyles, all cultures and all currents of thought. Those who embark on the road cannot allow themselves to be obtuse, at the risk of seeing all the roads close in front of them. Of course, we may not approve of all the routes, but we must grant them the courtesy of a minimum of consideration for their existence.  
  
Each quest follows a path, and the only way to complete the task at hand is to follow that path until its ultimate end. Of course, the more important the quest, the more winding the road and the more the secondary roads will be far from the real goal. Going right on these paths will be the key to success.

### Appearance and manifestations
Fharlanghn appears as an old wrinkled man, with brown weathered skin, but whose green eyes sparkling with life. He wears unremarkable, travel-stained clothing of leather and unbleached linen. His clothes and boots are always dirty due to his incessant journeys on roads and trails. He carries the Oerth Disc, a magical version of his holy symbol.  
  
When he meets travelers, he greets them politely and easily engages in conversation, although he is not very talkative. His movements seem slow and measured, but he actually moves very quickly, especially over long distances.

### Relationships and History
Fharlanghn is the lover of Atroa, goddess of the east wind. He is allied with Atroa, Celestian, Lydia, Brandobaris, Keoghtom (whose apotheosis he sponsored), Charmalaine (whose apotheosis he co-sponsored), Murlynd, Olidammara, Heward, and Aasterinian. Fharlanghn's brother Celestian, who is popular among planewalkers, is attempting to spread knowledge of Fharlanghn on the planes as well, though (as there are precious few horizons on planes other than the Prime Material) this is slow going.
