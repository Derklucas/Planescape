A power on good terms with both the Norse and Roman pantheons as well as her own fellow Gaulish powers, Nehalennia is a protector who watches over sailors, and to whom offerings are made for a safe voyage. When a sailor returns home in safety, he offers thanks to her. She is a close ally of Ã‹arendil the mariner, and is known to visit the Norse power at times. However, her strength may now be waning, and there are rumours that her seaport realm, [[Colijnsplaat]], may be about to slide into the sea to join Manannan mac Lir.
