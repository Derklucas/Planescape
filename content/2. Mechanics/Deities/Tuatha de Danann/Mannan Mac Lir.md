Manannan mac Lir is the power who reigns over the hidden Tir fo Thuinn, the Land Under the Waves. His domain, is a world apart, where the daily grind mirrors that of the surface—petitioners herd fish instead of livestock and toil under the sea in kelp beds and shellfish farms as they would on land. However, they’re known for their harsh treatment of those who face misfortune, not offering a helping fin to travellers in dire straits. If you can’t breathe here, or your magic runs out, that’s a you problem, berk.

Tir fo Thuinn, while within a stone’s throw of Tir na Og, is distinctly separate. Manannan mac Lir’s approval is crucial for anyone wishing to breathe underwater in his domain. He holds sway over all magic that allows one to breathe beneath the waves and isn’t shy about revoking this privilege if he senses misuse.

Tir fo Thuinn is a realm of stunning beauty, a tapestry of aquamarine and turquoise, adorned with shells and breathtaking seascapes. Rumour has it that Manannan mac Lir keeps some real peculiar beasts in shadowy grottos as his mounts, and the whispers go that some of these are possibly even his offspring. 

Manannan mac Lir and Poseidon have been rivals for millennia, but recently their relationship has thawed a little. It’s possible that this is just a cover for treachery that’s yet to occur though. Time will tell.

Manannan mac Lir’s proxies include Barin, a tiefling with skin patterned like a zebra fish, who guides lost visitors in Tir fo Thuinn and can revoke the gift of water breathing from those who displease mac Lir. The other is Barr-Find, a remarkably unattractive half-orc with a voice so enchanting that it has even made Oghma envious. Barr-Find can use his voice to shatter weapons and command sea creatures.
