Epona the Horsemaiden is the Celtic power of all things equine. Her deep connection with these noble creatures and those who work with them makes her a beloved figure among the Celts, who hold horses in the highest esteem. She’s best known as one of the Gaulish powers, although she’s also friendly with the Celtic powers in the Briton faction, as well as the Welsh powers—who call her Rhiannon.

Her realm within Tir na Og is known as Epona’s Stable, a place that is a haven for horses, from stallions and shirehorses to the tiny ponies and the ur’Epona that gambol freely in the vast rolling hills and meadows. Here, clear streams and shaded groves provide shelter, fresh water and the freedom to gallop freely and peacefully—equine paradise.

Epona appears as a timeless, ethereal woman, often bare to the waist and either riding a majestic white mare or seated on a throne, nurturing twin foals. Her association with twins, a phenomenon more common in horses than humans, highlights her role in overseeing all aspects of equine life. 

As a power who demands respect for her charges, Epona decrees that no Celt may consume horse meat. Epona is respected not only by the Celts but also by the Greek pantheon, although she isn’t quite a member of it yet—greybeards reckon it’s a matter of time before Zeus comes making an offer she should probably refuse…
