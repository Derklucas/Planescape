Airmed is one of the Celtic powers calling herself Tuatha Dé Danann. She’s the power of herbalism, and her tale is one of healing and heartache. 

When the Tuatha dé Danann fought the Fomorians in the Second Battle of Magh Tuiredh, and Airmed, alongside her old man, Dian Cécht, and her brother Miach, were right in the muddle, patching up the battered and the bruised Celtic powers. The Tuatha dé Danann had a rough time against the Fomorians, and it was Airmed and her kin who kept them from getting dead-booked for sure.

But it ain’t all rosy, see? Airmed’s tale takes a darker twist later when her own father, blinded by jealousy, offed her brother. Miach was a dab hand at healing, even outshining the old man by fixing up the hand that Nuada’s lost in the battle. Dian Cécht couldn’t stomach being bested by his own kin, and Miach ended up in the dead-book.

Now, here’s where it gets even more tragic. Airmed wept her heart out over Miach’s grave, and lo and behold, from her tears sprang forth a whole garden of healing herbs. Airmed gathered these herbs, knowing their worth and power. She laid them out on her cloak, sorting them, making sense of their magic and concoctin’ a plan to bring her brother back.

But Dian Cécht, still stewing in his own juices, wasn’t having any of it. In a fit, he scattered the herbs to the four winds, mixing them up so that no one, not even the brightest basher, could put them right again. That’s why, to this day, no one knows all the secrets of the green; that knowledge is locked up tight in Airmed’s heart.

Airmed wasn’t just about the herbs, though. In her father’s wandering absence, she’s now the guardian of the Well of Sláine, and by singing over it, she can bring the dead back to the land of the living. She has to be careful of course, because Arawn gets seriously piked off if souls starts disappearing from his lands, so Airmed has to be quick and subtle about it.
