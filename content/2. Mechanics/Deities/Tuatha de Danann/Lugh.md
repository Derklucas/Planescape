Lugh, the Celtic power of the arts, travel, and commerce, is a real mover and shaker in the pantheon, much like his brother [[Dian Cécht]]. This cutter is also on a never-ending quest for excellence, roaming the planes in search of new knowledge and experiences. It’s said that if he ever finds something he can’t do, he might finally settle down. But that day seems as far off as the Lady of Pain showing a smile.

Despite being a jack-of-all-trades, Lugh’s not the top dog in everything. He dabbles in arts, commerce, and travel, and he’s a dab hand at the cross-trade, but he’s always looking for more. A bit of a charmer, he’s known for wooing the ladies wherever he goes. He’s sometimes linked with Rosmerta, a goddess of wealth who’s a bit of a mystery herself.

Lugh’s hardly ever in Tir na Og. Chant goes he’s seen all there is to see there and only pops back when he fancies a bit of company from his fellow Celts. When he does, he’s a bit of a couch-surfer, crashing at the abode of whichever goddess will have him for the night. While he’s one of the Tuatha de Danann, Lugh is also friendly with the Gaulish powers, who call him Lug, and the Romans, who call him Lugus.

His main travelling companion is Samholdanach, a wild mage. There’s some chant that Samholdanach’s teaching Lugh about the order in the chaos of magic, but that’s likely just flam. Why would a god need lessons from a mortal? Nonetheless, Samholdanach’s got this nifty trick – the power of the radiant face. When he wants to, his mug shines with such beauty that it can blind any poor sod who can’t resist its magic.
