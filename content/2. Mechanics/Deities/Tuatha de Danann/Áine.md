Áine (pronounced AWN-ya or OIN-ya) is a multifaceted Celtic power, associated with summer, wealth, and sovereignty. She holds a special place in the hearts of those who cherish the warmth of summer and the abundance it brings.

Her realm in Tir na Og within the Outlands is a reflection of her dominion over the summer season. Here, the lands are perpetually bathed in the gentle warmth of a never-ending summer, fields lush with crops, and the air filled with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers. The Bánóg is a magical clearing of grass eternally ringed with flowers which is used for dancing.

Áine’s influence extends beyond the physical aspect of summer to embody the spiritual wealth and prosperity associated with this bountiful season. She is revered as a goddess of plenty, overseeing the growth and nurturing of crops and ensuring the land remains fertile and productive.

She appears as a radiant figure, her presence bringing life and energy to the world around her. She’s sometimes seen walking through the fields, her touch causing plants to bloom and flourish, or presiding over festivals that celebrate the peak of summer, with music, dancing, and feasting.

Áine’s followers and petitioners in Tir na Og are farmers, druids, and those who seek harmony with the natural world. They honour her through rituals and offerings that symbolise the fertility of the land and the prosperity it brings.
