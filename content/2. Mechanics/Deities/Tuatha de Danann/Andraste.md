Andraste is the Celtic goddess of victory. She is honoured by warriors on the eve of battles, and when a triumph has been won. Her worship takes place in wooded groves, and those desiring to win in combat release hares in her name. Her realm, Mount Victory, lies in the mountains ringward of the Bloody Field in Tir na Og. Her relations with Nike are cool at best: after all, thereâ€™s only ever one victor in a battle.
