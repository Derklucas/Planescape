Put on that metal helmet cutter, and let me whisper you the dark of Ilsensine, the mind behind the mind flayers and a real piece of work even by the Outlands‘ standards. Picture a great, green-glowing brain, tentacles sprawling out like the dark of a bad dream, reaching into the corners of the multiverse. This ain’t a normal kind of power by any stretch of the imagination; it’s a deity of thought, a master of knowledge so cold and calculating it’d freeze the blood in your veins.

Ilsensine’s got itself a realm of horrors deep under the Outlands, in the twisty, turny tunnels known as the Caverns of Thought. This place, it’s a mind-bender, a soul-twister. Get too close to the centre, where the Big Brain itself sits brooding in a pool of cerebral fluid, and you’ll start feeling the heavy weight of thoughts not your own. It’s like having your brainpan scrubbed with steel wool, only the scrubbing’s all psychic-like and less enjoyable.

### Dogma
Rule everything, enslave everyone. Simple, right cutter? But it’s the way it goes about it—through psychic domination, subjugation, a total psionic lockdown. It wants its illithid children on top, with all the rest of us “cattle” down below in the save pits, ready and ‘willing’ for the taking. And if you think you can shield your noodle from its noodling, think again. Venture too deep into its realm, and you’ll be lucky to leave with your wits about you.

### Relationships and History
This god-brain’s not one for company, except maybe for those with a hankering for brain-melting secrets and psionics powers. But here’s the catch: Ilsensine’s game is all about its own power. Not the kind you wield with a sword or a spell, but the raw, uncut stuff of the mind.
