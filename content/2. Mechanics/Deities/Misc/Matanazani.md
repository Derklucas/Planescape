With all the countless prime worlds worshipping powers there's bound to be the occasional god that no planar has heard of and no one really knows the dark of. Most cutters stay well away from these places, after all only the most leatherheaded sod would tread in the domain of a power without knowledge of what to expect, or what is expected from them. Matanazani's realm is different. Curiosity may kill the cat lord but in this realm it may very well change your life. See, the chant goes that Matanazani is the great neutraliser, the god of neutrality and viewpoint in whose presence high and mighty attitudes will shatter and berks can see an issue from all sides and viewpoints. Well, that's mostly screed.
