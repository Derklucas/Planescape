Ubtao (pronounced oob-TAY-oh), is a mysterious being indeed, also known as the Creator of Chult and the Father of the Dinosaurs. He’s a bit of an oddball among the gods, standing aloof from both mortals and powers. Some reckon he’s more primordial than divine, a fact that might explain his distant nature. Chant goes that during the ancient Shadow Epoch he betrayed his fellow primordials and aided the gods during the Dawn War. After that he settled down on Toril, created the vast jungle of Chult, filled it with creatures and especially dinosaurs, and then retreated into its unexplored depths. After Toril’s Time of Troubles, though, he started taking a bit more interest in his followers, showing himself in various avatars, like a powerful tabaxi male or a colossal tyrannosaurus rex—some might argue they preferred it when he was aloof! When he communicates, it’s often in cryptic messages, leaving his followers scratching their heads trying to interpret his will.

### Worship
Many Chultan people venerate Ubtao and believe that Ubtao created the jungle and all the humans and animals that populate this hot, green microcosm. Ubtao also raised the holy city of Mezro from the jungle with his own hands and resided there for a time—until the people drove him into the heavens with their nagging demands. Ubtao watches over the world with disinterest, letting women and men go about their lives without any interference. He demands no formal worship, but in return offers little divine guidance.

The church of Ubtao is split among several wholly independent sects, all based in the Jungles of Chult among the various clans of the humans: the Mazewalkers, Spiritlords, Jungle druids, and the Spearbearers of Ubtao.

#### Vestments
Mazewalkers favor loose-fitting tobes (TOE-bays) that are comfortable in the ever-present humidity. During worship ceremonies they adorn themselves with intricate designs painted around the eyes and tabards carved from wood and painted with intricate mazes. Spiritlords wear simple loincloths, even if the rest of the tribe favors robes, and sometime wear decorative overskirts made of long, furred animal tails. They adorn themselves with necklaces of animal and dinosaur fetishes and carry intricate masks carved from ironwood, which play a central role in their rituals. Jungle druids wear the garb common to their clans, but often decorate their garb with symbols or pictures of animals and dinosaurs. Mazewalkers and jungle druids usually wear a small depiction of a maze made of gold, silver, or (more typically) carved semiprecious stone, ivory, or bone as a holy symbol. Spiritlords's masks function as their holy symbols.

Mazewalkers, jungle druids, and spiritlords employ varieties of weapons, armor, and shields common to the Chult. The most common weapons employed by Chultan priests are a type of spear known as the yklwa and a type of club known as the kerrie. The yklwa is a short stabbing spear about 4 feet in length with a swordlike blade about 18 inches long (Weight 4, Piercing, Damage Id8/ldl0). The kerrie is a hardwood (typically ironwood) club with a long straight haft and a head that resembles a slightly flattened ball (Weight 4, Bludgeon, Damage 2d3/ld4+l). The knob may be faceted, and it can vary in size from that of a fist to much larger. The kerrie can be thrown with surprising accuracy. Other weapons commonly employed include short-handled hand axes, daggers, short swords, scimitars, long bows, and hunting spears.

High-ranking priests wear breastplates and helmets of dinosaur hide. Priests are proficient in the use of the shield.

#### Temples
The only true temple of Ubtao is known simply as the Temple of Ubtao or the _Maze of Life_, and it dominates the city of Mezro. Members and clergy from all three faiths may worship there. The temple does not hold any organized services, though impromptu ones may be organized among those present at the temple or groups may independently request that a time or day be held open for their use.

### Dogma
Ubtao created the jungle as a test for his people, a maze for them to pass through on their way to a heavenly afterlife. Learn the maze that represents your life, for you must know it when you meet Ubtao in the afterlife. Understand your place in the jungle, represented by your maze. Respect the dinosaur, for they are the Children of Ubtao, agents of his will and gifts of his bounty.

### Appearance and manifestations
Ubtao is commonly depicted as a powerfully built Chultan male of indeterminate age. He has distant eyes, dark brown skin the color of fertile earth, closely cropped black hair, and a neatly trimmed goatee. He is endlessly patient and rarely emotional.  
  
Ubtao appears most commonly as a gigantic tyrannosaurus rex.

### Relationships and History
Ubtao's only ally is Thard Harr. Likewise, Ubtao's chief foe (other than Eshowdow) is Sseth, an aspect of Set acting as deity of the yuan-ti.
