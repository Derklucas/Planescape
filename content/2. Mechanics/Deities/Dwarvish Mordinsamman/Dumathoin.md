Dumathoin is the patron of mountain dwarves, and the dwarf deity of mining and underground exploration. He is also the protector of the dwarven dead.

Dumathoin hides the secrets of the earth until deserving and diligent dwarves are ready to be guided to them. He lays veins of iron, copper, gold, silver, and mithral where he feels they will best benefit his followers. He watches over the safety and security of miners of all races and has a special role as the protector of shield dwarves and the creator of the urdunnirin.

### Worship
All dwarves who live in (or venture into) subterranean areas or mountains, or those who work directly with the riches of the earth, worship the Silent Keeper. All dwarven miners and many nondwarven ones at least appease him, even if they do not fully support him. Miners in the North and dwarves throughout the Realms often carry a small diamond, agate, or other gemstone (of about 10 gp value) with them to attract his favor.  
  
Priests of Dumathoin always seek to uncover the buried wealth of the earth without marring the beauty of the ways beneath the surface or being overly greedy. They often supervise mining operations and maintain underground safety and security. They work to clean up the rubble of mining, to grow and put in place luminous fungi and edible deep-mosses, and to direct water through the earth to best serve the underlife that includes, of course, dwarves. Priests of this faith are always hunting for new veins of ore, new sources and species of useful fungi, and new delves or underways never explored before. They try to identify encountered dangers and determine strategies to deal with these menaces of the deep places appropriately. They also bargain with other (non-hostile) underground races to avoid over-exploitation of resources.

#### Hierarchy
Novices of Dumathoin are known as the _Uncut_. Upon taking the Silent Vow, they become full priests and are known as _Keepers of the Shield_. In ascending order of rank, the titles used by the Keepers of the Shield are _Agate_, _Onyx_, _Amethyst_, _Jargoon_, _Garnet_, _Topaz_, _Opal_, _Sapphire_, and _Diamond_. The highest ranking priests of Dumathoin are collectively known as _Beljurils_, but most have unique individual titles as well. Specialty priests are known as _delvesonns_, a dwarvish word that can be loosely translated at "Dumathoin's hidden gifts."

#### Vestments
Dumathoin's clergy favor leather garments, whether they be armor or mining gear. They keep their heads bare and wear earth-brown cloaks and over-robes. Like all dwarves, they grow their hair and beards long, but none of the Silent Keeper's generally hirsute priests braid or trim their hair. The holy symbol of the faith is a miniature silver pick.  
  
In times of likely strife, Dumathoin's priests garb themselves in the most effective armor and weapons available. The Silent Keeper's clergy members typically favor picks, hammers, and other mining tools in combat, but they are usually proficient in the use of a wide range of weapons.

#### Temples
While shrines and temples of Dumathoin are typically found in the holds of the shield dwarves, they are extremely rare among the other dwarven subraces, except for the gold dwarves—in whose realms they are merely uncommon. Dumathoin's clergy builds underground temples in the deepest caverns, always near an impressive vein of precious metal or a bed of natural gems. Such bounty remains a part of the temple and free from harvest as a testament to the local clan leader's reverence for the Silent Keeper. At the heart of such temples are simple altars consisting of natural boulders or large stone blocks. Statues of the Silent Keeper, depicting him in his many aspects, line the walls.

### Dogma
Walk the deep and silent ways of Dumatoin. Seek out the hidden gifts of the Keeper of Secrets under the Mountain. That which is hidden is precious, and that which is precious shall stay hidden. Seek to enhance the natural beauty of Dumathoin's gifts and go with, not against, the contours of the deeps. Beauty is the discovery and the crafting, not the holding. Keep the places of our dead inviolate and well tended; the noble ancestors of our race will neither be robbed nor moved through the actions of thieves and defilers. Abide not undead creatures, especially those that take the form of dwarves, thus mocking the creation of Moradin.

### Appearance and manifestations
Dumathoin is described as a gigantic male dwarf with a barrel chest. His hair and beard are sculpted gray stone, and his skin is earth-brown in color. His eyes are silvery flame. He carries a two-handed mattock made from solidified magma. Dumathoin never speaks and instead communicates with gestures and the occasional grunt or sigh.

### Relationships and History
Dumathoin is a rival of his brother Abbathor, who hoped to become patron of the mountain dwarves before Dumathoin was given that position by Moradin. Abbathor is also infuriated that Dumathoin hides precious metals and gems where he cannot find them.  
  
The Silent Keeper is allied with Calladuran Smoothhands, Cyrrollalee, Grumbar, Flandal Steelskin, Segojan Earthcaller, Sehanine Moonbow, Skoraeus Stonebones, Urogalan, and every dwarf god except for Abbathor and Laduguer. He is friendly with other nondwarven gods of mines and smiths. He names among his foes Abbathor, Kiaransali, Laduguer, Urdlen, and the gods of the goblins, kobolds, orcs, and evil giants. His relationship with the illithid god Ilsensine, whose divine realm his realm overlaps, is nonhostile, though the exact relationship between the two gods is a mystery. Their respective worshippers are hostile to one another, however.  
  
The naga deity Parrafaire serves Dumathoin (among other deities), aiding him in protecting his secrets with tricks, traps, and puzzles.
