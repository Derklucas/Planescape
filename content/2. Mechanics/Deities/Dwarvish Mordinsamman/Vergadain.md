Vergadain, also known as The Laughing Dwarf by non-dwarves, is the neutral dwarven deity of luck, trickery, negotiation and wealth, and sometimes considered an exarch of Moradin.

While it seemed that Vergadain represented the dwarves' well-known dedication to the mercantile art of bargaining, those who knew better were aware that he had an aspect that seldom filled the more legal-minded dwarves with pride. As such, Vergadain also watched over those dwarves who used less-than-legal means to gain wealth. Regardless of how he was viewed, Vergadain delighted in the art of the deal, no matter what it was, so long as it turned a profit.

### Worship
In the knowledgeable society, few admit to following Vergadain, as those who profess adherence to his doctrine are known as either skilled negotiators, shameless thieves, or both. Clerics are dedicated to furthering the progress of dwarven commerce and travel the world more widely than the servants of any member of the Morndinsamman (except Marthammor Duin). The Merchant King expects all his clerics to be personally wealthy, and to ensure that a portion of their wealth goes to keeping the local temple. When clerics multiclass, they typically do so as rogues.

#### Hierarchy
Priests of Vergadain are called the _Hurndor_ ("those who trade"). Novitiates are the _Impoverished_, whilst full priests are called _Gilded Merchants_, ascending through the ranks of _Alloyn_, _Copprak_, _Argentle_, _Electrol_, _Aurak_ and _High Aurak_. The senior priests are called the _Merchant Princes_.

#### Vestments
Clerics of Vergadain favor rich robes of obvious cost studded with gems and trimmed with furs. A string of linked gold coins is draped over the shoulders and around the neck. Gold and deep purple are preferred for colors. Ceremonial armor includes ornate chainmail, a gem-studded gorget bearing Vergadain's symbol, and an elaborately decorated helm. Senior priests are expected to have their ceremonial armor plated in gold—it's quite a dishonor if they can't afford this—and junior priests who can afford to do this as well are considered marked for great status.

#### Temples
Temples to Vergadain are either windowless vaults deep in the ground, or fortress-like vaults above-ground; they are filled with treasures donated by the faithful, but also guarded with traps and enchanted devices called _guardian anators_, which can blast trespassers and thieves with lightning bolts and magic missiles (unless a secret pass phase is uttered, usually only known to high priests). The center of every temple is a huge stone cauldron, which serves as an altar to Vergadain; offerings to the god are tossed inside.

### Dogma
The truly blessed are those whose enterprise and zeal brings both wealth and good luck. Work hard, be clever, seek the best bargain, and the Merchant King will shower you with gold. Treat others with respect, but shirk not your responsibility to try to strike a deal better for you than for them.

### Appearance and manifestations
Vergadain appears as a tall dwarf dressed in the brown and yellow garb of a merchant; often his clothes are dusty from his long travels. Underneath this, he wears armor and often carries musical instruments (Vergadain has a great singing voice and is said to be a great poet), disguises, and sacks of treasure protected with poisonous snakes and vermin. His boots contain concealed weapons such as knives or garrotes, or hidden places or both. His eyes sparkle enigmatically, and he smiles more than any other dwarven god.

### Relationships and History
Vergadain was very popular among the Morndinsamman, while sharing a particularly strong friendship with [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], as they shared an interest in mischief. He also occasionally partnered with Abbathor, a relationship that they both would have described as a "business arrangement". After traveling throughout Faerûn, Vergadain had also gained many allies among the non-dwarf mercantine deities.
