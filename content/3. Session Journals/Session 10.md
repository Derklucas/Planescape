### Summary

Still. In. Crust. I am so sick of this town. Everything is the same. It's all just darkness, sad people and bad smells. Luckily Thelemachus spoke to a man who know the way out of this prison town. He is hiding here from the [[Mercykillers]].

Apparently the man's a convicted felon, although he himself doesn't seem to agree... Anyhow, Blue Whisper tried to buy him some time by talking to his mercy killer colleagues. We also promised to help this man’s son, Vellek, escape from this filthy place. So at last we were able to leave [[Crust]].

The good news: we updated our [[Mimir]]! So now it contains all of the boring information we gathered about Crust. Bad news: we stumbled upon two gigantic river monsters when we portaled out of this town. They made a low humming sound so we all filled our ears with some weird substance Telemachus gave us;

I still feel kind of light in my head because of that. We prepared ourselves for combat. I could see the rage bubbling in her eyes from under her cloak (she’s always so dramatic). Vellek hid himself behind a pile of trash. And me? O hell no I was letting these creatures damage my lute! 

Some hypnotic tunes did the trick. While those monsters were reaching other wavelengths, we made sure to leave as quick as possible. Of course Telemachus had to think twice before joining us, such a peculiar man it is… Anyways, it took us some time but we’re on the road again. No more death and destruction, for now.
