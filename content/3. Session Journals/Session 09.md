### Summary

After leaving the chaos of [[Torch]] behind, the party set the [[Walking castle |Iedcaru]] on course for the next Gate Town: [[Hopeless]]. As the walking castle marched forward, the landscape around them began to change. Colors drained from the world, turning the earth and sky into a dull, lifeless gray. Soon, the effect spread to their own bodies—their skin, clothes, and even the [[Walking castle |Iedcaru]] itself dulled, losing all vibrancy. The air grew heavy, and a sense of futility weighed on their minds. The name [[Hopeless]] wasn't just a title; it was a creeping feeling that threatened to overwhelm them.

The deeper they ventured, the worse the sensation became. Their thoughts slowed, clouded by a pervasive sense of despair. [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]]' prayers felt distant, and even the magical items they carried lost their gleam. It became clear that [[Hopeless]] was more than they had bargained for, and they quickly realized they couldn’t afford to linger in such a soul-sapping place.

Without hesitation, [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]] urged [[Zaythir]] to change course, steering the [[Walking castle |Iedcaru]] toward [[Curst]]. Anything was better than the heavy, suffocating hopelessness that surrounded them. As the [[Walking castle |Iedcaru]] turned away, the party began to feel some of the weight lift, leaving the gray wasteland behind as they pressed on toward the next leg of their journey, hoping [[Curst]] would prove more manageable.

As the [[Walking castle |Iedcaru]] made its way toward [[Curst]], the landscape began to change once again. The jagged volcanic peaks of [[Torch]] gave way to an endless expanse of red desert, the air thick with heat and dust. The sky above was a deep, bruised red, mirroring the sands below. After hours of travel, the party spotted their destination in the distance: a massive, circular town surrounded by a thirty-foot-high wall of black iron bars, guarded by hulking [[Maelephant]] sentinels. There was only one way in—a single, open gate that seemed to beckon with the promise of imprisonment. [[Curst]] was infamous for one thing: once you entered, you couldn’t leave without the blessing of [[The Burgomaster]].

As the party approached the gate, their legs grew inexplicably heavy, as if an invisible weight had been shackled to their ankles. They could feel the pull of the town, the invisible chains binding them to this place of exile and punishment. [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]], having spent time in [[Curst]] as an exile before, was especially hesitant, but with no other clear options, the party crossed the threshold, entering the prison-town with a palpable sense of dread.

Inside, the air was thick with despair. [[Curst]] was no ordinary town—it was a place where hope went to die. The only pub they found was filled with somber faces and hushed voices. Inside, they heard little of value, but outside, [[Blue Whisper]] encountered a beggar with a strange look in his eye. The man’s tongue had been cut out, but through her telepathic connection, [[Blue Whisper]] learned his name: **Belis the Mute**. He shared rumors of a [[R04M |Modron]] in the town, though it was more legend than fact, as no one had seen it recently.

Hoping for more answers, the party made their way to the towering manor of [[The Burgomaster]]. The building was a grotesque monument to suffering—a three-story structure that resembled a massive, twisted cage. A reddish glow seeped from the slanted windows, casting an eerie, menacing light over the spiked veranda, giving the place the look of a grimacing, sinister face. Outside, they were met by a [[Farastu Demodand]] guard who begrudgingly allowed [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]] an audience with the town’s ruler, known as **Villigus Bazengar**.

Inside, [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]] found [[The Burgomaster]] sitting on a grotesque throne of bone and iron, his form towering and misshapen. **Villigus Bazengar** had oily, pale skin, with eyes that burned like embers beneath a wide, toothy grin. His voice was thick with contempt as [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]] pleaded for information about the [[R04M |Modron]]. But [[The Burgomaster]] simply waved off his concerns, his tone dripping with cruelty, and dismissed him from the manor without a second thought.

Frustrated, the party continued searching the town for any sign of the [[R04M |Modron]], but the answers they found were as vague and hopeless as the place itself. Everyone had heard rumors, but no one had seen the mechanical being in some time. Was it gone? Hidden? No one could say. Exhausted and with no way out, they retired to one of the cramped barracks, hoping to rest and gather their thoughts.

Yet as they lay in the dim barracks, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] felt something unsettling. He knew—without a doubt—they were being followed.

Before the party settled down for the night, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] slipped out of the barracks, the weight of [[Curst]] pressing heavily on his shoulders. He moved quietly through the oppressive streets, his instincts guiding him toward something—or someone—lurking in the shadows. Unbeknownst to him, [[Blue Whisper]] had noticed his absence and tried to follow, but the weariness of the day clung to her, causing her to lose track of his movements in the maze-like streets of the prison-town.

As [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] pressed forward, a figure emerged from the gloom—a weathered man with a tattered cloak draped over his scarred frame. His face was a map of old wounds, but he carried himself with undeniable confidence. In a low, gravelly voice, the stranger said, "They say no one leaves [[Curst]]. Really, you just need the right friends to get out, and you all look like you're in the friend-making mood." The man introduced himself as **Valder**, an ex-[[Mercykillers |Mercykiller]] in exile. Decades ago, he had defied the [[Mercykillers]] by refusing to bring in a bounty he knew was innocent, a decision that led to the deaths of his fellow faction members and his subsequent exile in [[Curst]].

Valder revealed a personal tragedy: he had abandoned his family when he fled [[Sigil]], only to be tracked down years later by his son, **Fellik**. Though the reunion had healed some of the old wounds between them, it had come too late—Fellik had already died and returned as a petitioner, a lost soul trapped in [[Curst]]. Now, Valder wanted to help his son escape to the afterlife he deserved, but he needed to know if he could trust the party. His request was simple yet grim—kill the two [[Mercykillers]] sent to [[Curst]] to finish him off, and in return, he would show them a way out of the town. After a long conversation, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] nodded and returned to the barracks, burdened with the decision. He was quiet the next morning, keeping Valder’s offer in his thoughts as the party resumed their search for any clues to the [[R04M |Modron]]’s whereabouts.

Later that day, while scouring the streets, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] and [[Blue Whisper]] spotted two [[Mercykillers]] watching them from a rooftop. As the rogue expressed her desire to approach them, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] revealed Valder’s story and the deal he had been offered the previous night. [[Blue Whisper]] was incredulous, unable to believe that a fellow faction member could have fallen so far. Nevertheless, they decided to hear the [[Mercykillers]] out before making a decision.

The [[Mercykillers]] confirmed Valder’s grim fate. They had been sent to carry out his execution, and his blood would reveal their escape route from [[Curst]]. The blank paper they carried would magically show the way out once it was stained with Valder’s blood. If the party helped them complete the task, they could leave [[Curst]] alongside them, their only chance of escape now resting on the razor’s edge of a moral dilemma.
