### Summary

After some deliberation, the party decided to send [[walking castle |Iedcaru]] toward [[Torch]], the dangerous and volatile Gate Town they had learned about from the [[Mimir]]. With a few words spoken by [[Zaythir]], the ancient walking castle powered up, and the party felt a deep rumble beneath their feet. The sensation of movement was strange, almost disorienting, as the castle's massive legs began to stride forward through the vast, unpredictable landscape of the Outlands.

The journey ahead would be long, so the group took this rare moment of downtime to delve deeper into the knowledge stored within the castle’s library. They spent hours—or perhaps days—poring over ancient tomes about the planes and Gate Towns, trying to uncover anything that might aid them in their quest to find [[R04M]]. [[Jillian Tealeaf |Jillian]], with her natural curiosity and charm, experimented further with the [[Mimir]], hoping to uncover more esoteric knowledge about the Outlands.

However, as they cycled through its stored recordings, they noticed something troubling. The [[Mimir]] was missing crucial information on several Gate Towns—[[Automata]], Curst, Excelsior, Faunel, Glorium, Rigus, and Sylvania. This gap in knowledge might prove vital later on, and the party realized that re-recording the lost information could unlock significant pieces of the puzzle. They made a mental note of this task, understanding that it might take them to each of these places eventually.

While the others focused on the [[Mimir]], [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] became engrossed in an old book on the shelves, something about it calling to him. The tome described the **[[Rilmani]]**, beings of pure neutrality that he had glimpsed in his visions. These creatures, said to dwell near the base of The Spire—the mysterious pinnacle that rose impossibly high from the center of the Outlands—were neither good nor evil, law nor chaos. They acted as cosmic mediators, striving to maintain the balance of the multiverse. This revelation stirred something in [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]], but he couldn’t yet place why. The [[Rilmani]] might hold answers, but for now, they remained an enigma.

Time passed, but in the Outlands, it was hard to tell if it had been hours or days. The strange flux of reality made it difficult to grasp the passage of time, and the monotony of [[walking castle |Iedcaru]]’s steady march lulled them into a dreamlike state. The endless horizon stretched before them, an ever-shifting mix of terrains, where the laws of nature seemed to bend and break.

Suddenly, their peaceful study was interrupted by an enormous sound—an earth-shaking boom followed by the unmistakable noise of something flapping against the air, a noise so loud it reverberated through the stone walls of the castle. The floor beneath them dipped slightly, as though [[walking castle |Iedcaru]] had been thrown off balance. The party sprang into action, grabbing their weapons and racing outside.

They emerged into the open air, greeted by an astonishing sight. Towering above the walking castle was a massive silver dragon, its wings outstretched and shimmering with a radiant glow that seemed to bend time itself. The creature’s mere presence exuded power and ancient wisdom, but what was most striking wasn’t just its size or beauty—it was the way the dragon looked at them. Like old friends reunited after a long journey.

With a low, rumbling voice that seemed to stretch across both time and space, the dragon greeted each of them by name: [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]], [[Blue Whisper]], [[Jillian Tealeaf |Jillian]], [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]], and [[Forgor Fumblefoot |Forgor]]. It was as though he had known them for lifetimes. The party, confused but intrigued, exchanged glances. None of them had any memory of meeting this dragon before. The dragon, sensing their confusion, introduced herself as **[[Renesupra]]**, a time dragon who had crossed their paths countless times in other timelines. But in this one, it seemed, they were meeting for the first time.

[[Azhari XIII |Azhari]], ever the inquisitive warlock, tried to pry further into the nature of their strange connection, eager to learn more about their future. He pressed [[Renesupra]] with questions, hoping for some glimpse into what lay ahead. But the dragon, wise in the ways of time, gently declined to answer. To meddle with the timeline, [[Renesupra]] explained, could alter the outcomes of their lives in ways that even she could not predict. "Some things," she said with a sad smile, "are better left unknown."

Before departing, the great dragon bestowed a gift upon them. Turning to [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]], [[Renesupra]] extended one massive claw and placed a strange, glowing orb in his hands. The orb thrummed with a powerful, ancient energy, its surface flickering with hues of silver. "Give this to the one who sees silver," she told him, her voice carrying an air of both instruction and mystery. [[Telemachus]] held the orb carefully, feeling its weight and wondering what purpose it might serve.

With that final gift, [[Renesupra]] unfurled her enormous wings and leapt into the sky. She paused only for a moment, hovering above them as her form began to fade, the fabric of time seeming to ripple around her. Then, in a blinding flash of silver light, she disappeared into a portal.

As the journey through the Outlands continued, the landscape outside shifted abruptly. The once strange but varied terrain of the planes transformed into a desolate, barren wasteland. The ground cracked and dry, with a faint, dust-filled wind that made visibility difficult. The oppressive atmosphere seemed to weigh on them, adding to the mystery of their destination. Eventually, in the middle of this forsaken expanse, they came upon a small, dilapidated shop—a lone stand that looked wildly out of place amidst the endless wasteland.

The sign above the shop read [[Bram’s Folly]], a name that seemed almost mocking in its isolation. Curious, the party approached, and they were greeted by a peculiar figure—[[Bram]], a wiry, gray-skinned dust mephit, lounging lazily on a pile of bricks. His beady eyes blinked slowly as he took in the sight of the party. He introduced himself with a scratchy voice and a wry smile, telling them the unfortunate tale of how he had been cheated out of a substantial inheritance long ago. What he had ended up with instead was the deed to this barren stretch of land, far from anything of note.

Despite the apparent misfortune, [[Bram]] seemed oddly content. “It’s peaceful here,” he said with a shrug. “I sell mud, tar, bricks, and stones to the occasional traveler. Not much, but it’s enough for me. The landscape never changes, but I like it that way.”

The party, intrigued by his strange shop, asked if he had seen any travelers pass by recently—specifically a modron. [[Bram]] scratched his chin thoughtfully. “A modron?” he repeated. “Aye, I did see one in the distance some time ago. Don’t know exactly when it was—time’s funny out here, doesn’t move like it does elsewhere. Could’ve been days, could’ve been years.” He pointed vaguely toward the horizon. “It was heading outward from the Spire. Maybe toward Curst or [[Torch]], though I’m not certain.”

The information, while helpful, wasn’t quite the lead they had hoped for. [[Blue Whisper]], always quick with a clever suggestion, eyed the piles of bricks stacked in haphazard towers around [[Bram]]’s stand. “You know,” she said, a glint of mischief in her eyes, “you could really drum up business if you sold novelty bricks. Make them say something like, ‘I visited Bram’s Folly and all I got was this brick.’ It’d give travelers something to remember this place by.”

[[Bram]]’s eyes lit up, and he let out a raspy laugh. “Now there’s a marvelous idea!” he exclaimed, his voice crackling with excitement. He immediately dug through a pile of bricks behind him, muttering to himself, and soon produced a crude but solid brick with the inscription hastily scratched into its surface.

With a grand gesture, he presented the first 'I visited Bram’s Folly' brick to [[Blue Whisper]], beaming with pride. “Here, take this as a token of my appreciation! You’ve just made me a richer mephit, you have.”

[[Blue Whisper]] accepted the novelty brick with a smirk, the absurdity of the situation not lost on the group. They exchanged a few more pleasantries with [[Bram]], who seemed genuinely grateful for the idea, and prepared to continue their journey.

Before leaving, [[Azhari XIII |Azhari]] asked once more about the modron, but [[Bram]] couldn’t recall any additional details. “Sorry, friend. It was just a glimpse, nothing more.” With that, the party bid [[Bram]] farewell, knowing their next stop would likely take them closer to their elusive quarry.

As they left [[Bram]] and his odd little shop behind, the strange brick now tucked safely away in [[Blue Whisper]]’s pack, the barren wasteland stretched before them once again. The castle’s legs began to move, striding ever forward toward the mysterious Gate Town of [[Torch]], where more answers—and more danger—awaited them.

The journey continued as the party set off once again on [[walking castle |Iedcaru]], the colossal walking castle carrying them ever closer to the treacherous Gate Town of [[Torch]]. As they ventured deeper into the outlands, the once desolate landscape gradually became more jagged and hostile. Sharp, rocky outcrops jutted from the earth, and the ground beneath their feet grew rough and uneven. The sky took on a deep red hue, dark clouds gathering ominously overhead, and the distant glow of molten lava became visible as they neared the volcanic peaks that dominated [[Torch]]'s skyline.

In the distance, the three towering volcanoes that formed [[Torch]] loomed ever larger, their slopes lined with hardened rivers of once-flowing magma. Occasionally, a burst of heat and ash would rise from the tops of the mountains, filling the air with the acrid scent of brimstone. The oppressive atmosphere only grew heavier the closer they came. Eventually, about ten miles from their destination, [[Zaythir]] brought [[walking castle |Iedcaru]] to a halt.

“The magic of [[Torch]] is too unstable,” she explained, her voice echoing through the castle halls. “Any closer, and [[walking castle |Iedcaru]] could be drawn into its chaotic energies.” Reluctantly, the party agreed to proceed on foot from here.

The climb up the side of one of the three volcanoes was grueling. The air was thick with ash, and the ground was a treacherous mix of jagged volcanic rock and loose gravel. Streams of lava cut through the landscape, winding like fiery veins across the mountainside. The temperature rose with every step, the heat from the molten rivers burning through their boots and the faint smell of sulfur stinging their nostrils. It was an unforgiving place, hostile in every way.

As they trudged onward, something strange began to happen. A faint sound reached their ears, an odd jingling noise, like the chime of tiny bells carried on the wind. They slowed, looking at each other in confusion. The sound grew louder, and then they realized—it was coming from their pockets. Their gold and jewelry were making noise, softly at first, then louder the more valuable the item. Coins clinked against each other, and gemstones hummed with an eerie resonance. The more valuable the item, the louder the sound, drawing unwanted attention in this volatile place.

[[Azhari XIII |Azhari]], sensing the danger, quickly tried to stow the valuables inside his magical lamp. But as soon as he did, a loud, high-pitched screeching noise erupted from the lamp, echoing through the volcanic pass. The piercing sound was unbearable, forcing him to immediately pull everything out again. Something about the magic of [[Torch]] twisted even his genie’s lamp. In a hurried scramble, the party divided the wealth amongst themselves once more, but when they counted it again, they discovered a portion of their gold had already been stolen—plucked from their very pockets by unseen hands.

They exchanged worried glances, realizing that [[Torch]] was as treacherous as they had been warned. They needed shelter, and fast.

Not far from the volcano's base, they spotted a large establishment—a sprawling, raucous bar marked with a sign that read Festhall of the Falling Coin. Inside, the place was pure chaos. Maaleths were wrestling with yugoloths over glittering piles of gold, and fiends of all kinds were embroiled in vicious brawls over contracts and loot. The noise was deafening, a cacophony of metal clanging, shouted curses, and the constant thrum of greed permeating the air.

The party pushed their way through the mayhem, finding a small spot at a long table near the back of the festhall. The table was sticky with spilled ale, and the air was thick with the scent of sweat and smoke. From this vantage point, they could see a male drow, his pale white hair slicked back, standing on an overlooking balcony with an air of quiet authority. His gaze was sharp and calculating as he observed the chaos below.

When a waitress approached, bringing them a round of ale, [[Telemachus Vaeloren |Telemachus]] asked about the drow. “That’s Badurth,” she explained with a shrug, “the proprietor. He runs this place and keeps things in order… or as close to order as you can get in a place like [[Torch]].”

The party, feeling uneasy in the lawless surroundings, decided to approach Badurth for information. They climbed the stairs to the upper level where he stood, his expression cold and indifferent as they approached. Badurth listened as they inquired about modrons, specifically any sightings of their quarry, [[R04M]].

“If a modron had passed through here,” he said coolly, “I would have known.” He cast a disdainful glance at the chaos below. “No, no modrons in [[Torch]]. Not in recent memory.”

The answer did little to soothe their nerves, and after exchanging a few more words with Badurth, the party decided it would be best to leave the festhall. Despite the protection offered by the walls of the bar, they felt exposed—like easy prey in this place where greed ruled all. They had what little information they could gather, and with the constant sense of being watched, they were eager to return to [[walking castle |Iedcaru]], hoping the walking castle would offer them more safety than this dangerous, chaotic Gate Town.
