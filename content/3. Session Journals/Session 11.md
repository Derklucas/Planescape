### Summary

The party—Blue Whisper, Azhari XIII, Jillian Tealeaf, and Forgor Fumblefoot—continued their journey after escaping Curst, bringing along the human petitioner, Vellik. Their destination: Excelsior, though they quickly discovered Vellik had nothing to offer them in return for his rescue.

The party traveled as the walking castle Iedcaru rose and began its slow march toward Excelsior. They gathered some knowledge about Excelsior from books along the way.

During their travels, a Kolyarut—an imposing and mechanical enforcer of cosmic law—appeared on the castle. Introducing himself as **Final Arbiter 717**, he interrogated the party about their origins, purpose, and destination, searching for any connection to anomalies in the multiverse. After performing his calculations, he determined they were not guilty and advised them to continue working within the framework of the multiverse before teleporting away.

Upon reaching Excelsior, the party visited the Forum, seeking information on the Modrons. Blue Whisper and Forgor discovered that the Modrons had a tarnished reputation. Forgor persuaded a local to share an important piece of history—2.5 years ago, during the Modron March, the constructs razed Heart’s Faith, demolishing an orphanage and a library that stood in their path. The mayor at the time, Cauldronborn, was found guilty of negligence and exiled.

Jillian remembered that the party had been present during the raid, assisting in the chaos. She recalled that Cauldronborn was not as incompetent as the public believed. Meanwhile, Azhari hypothesized that the missing Mimir recordings correlated with places negatively affected by the Modrons. Jillian built upon this theory, recalling that the party had lost their memories in Automata while following the Modron March. They speculated that Final Arbiter 717 might have been investigating their knowledge of these events.

A commotion from the amphitheater interrupted their discussion. A fiend took the stage, invoking an ancient contract allowing him to debate in Excelsior once every 1,000 years. He chose the topic: **the price of a soul**, and sought an opponent. Azhari stepped forward to face him, but Blue Whisper subtly assisted using her psionic abilities.

The fiend attempted to undermine Azhari by making it personal, highlighting his past—how he sold his soul to a genie, and how his father fell due to greed. Azhari stood firm, countering each argument:

1. **“I am not my father.”**
    
2. **“If one sells a soul, it is their own to sell.”**
    
3. **“Virtue comes from choice. Everyone is born free, and no soul is owned.”**
    

Refusing to be shaken, Azhari won the debate, forcing the fiend to be banished back to the Nine Hells. In recognition of his victory, the angels of Excelsior awarded him a boon.

Seeking more information on the exiled mayor, the party learned that Cauldronborn now resides in **Wonderhome**. They also discovered that the Modron **R04M** had been in Excelsior and had climbed the **Godstrand**, a towering mountain. Suspecting a connection, they traced a direct line from Godstrand to Heart’s Faith.

In Heart’s Faith, they visited a library named after **Telemachus Vaeloren**, honored as the **Savior of Knowledge**. Unlike others who saved orphans during the Modron raid, Telemachus had preserved invaluable knowledge, earning reverence from the local librarian.

Returning to Excelsior, the party climbed the Godstrand for hours, recording the Mimir for posterity. Upon descending, they were approached by a **Hound Archon**, a peacekeeper of Excelsior. He sought their help in investigating a missing persons case. Offering a reward of **2,500 gold pieces and a brooch**, he explained that five individuals had disappeared recently, and a suspect—**Sincerity**, a female tiefling—had been apprehended.

The party chose to search Sincerity’s home before questioning her. Blue Whisper deftly picked the lock, revealing a modest apartment devoid of hidden compartments or suspicious items. However, on the balcony, they discovered a cage holding eight **sunflies**. When they opened the cage, one sunfly stepped forward, extending its tiny paws as if requesting a hug, but ultimately returned to the cage after receiving no response.

Jillian canvassed the neighborhood, speaking with a gnome neighbor who vouched for Sincerity’s kindness. The gnome mentioned that she kept sunflies as pets and had been arrested merely for being near a disappearance site. He firmly believed in her innocence.

Finally, the party interrogated **Sincerity** at the guard hall. She denied all accusations but lacked an alibi, stating she was either at home or volunteering at a children’s music school. When questioned about the sunflies, she simply said she kept them because she enjoyed their colors.

With conflicting information and no clear evidence against Sincerity, the party now faces the challenge of uncovering the true culprit behind the disappearances. The case remains open, and their investigation continues...
