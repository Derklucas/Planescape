### Summary

**Written by:** Jillian Tealeaf

I cannot express how thrilled I feel! Where do I begin. So the five of us woke up in this ice-cold place. It seemed like we were on our own, when all of a sudden, this flying skull greets us! Fittingly, his name was Mort. We asked him if he knew how we got there, but he couldn’t tell us much. We walked out of the room we woke up in, and discovered at least three doors that could be opened. There was a strange slushing sound coming from the door on the right. I felt that there was something weird about to happen. My curiosity got the best of me, so Azhari and I went into the room, to find a grim doctor slushing into a corps. What a horrible sight his was! The doctor started attacking Azhari. You bet I wouldn’t let him damage my precious lute, so I kept my distance. Together we put down both the doctor and the half-dead body. Telemachus found a key in the corps, which he dutiful held on to.

We continued our mission to find a way out of this depressing place. The next door we stumbled upon opened a room in which a rather joyful scene was taking place. It seemed like three skeletons were enjoying a puppet show, performed by two puppets happily dancing and acting through the room. I tried making contact with the skeletons, but they didn’t respond whatsoever, rude. Blue Whisper then crawled through the room, and found a mysterious letter. It was an invitation to a masked ball, hosted by Lady Selene Shadowmoon. I couldn’t be more excited! I mean, this would be the opportunity to share my best songs.

We heard a muffled cry for help from the next door we wanted to open. The room was filled with lockers, probably to store corpses. We heard a desperate voice from one of the lockers: ‘Hello is there anybody there! My name is Furf.’ – Frurth, Flurf? He should have spoken more clearly – ‘I’m a Halfling. This is my first day here and somebody accidentally locked me up! Heeeelp’ Everyone tried to open the locker, but without success. Sometimes it just comes down to a little breathing technique. I eventually opened the locker, and Furf very thankfully hugged me. This Furf was a nice fella, although not the smartest. He did tell us that we could get out of here by going through the burn room. We’d just have to be VERY sure no one pulls the red lever, unless we want to burn to death. Eventually we checked all the other lockers. Telemachus couldn’t contain his excitement when he managed to use his key on one of the lockers, and found in it a bedazzled goblet, a manifesto and a spell scroll.

Next up, we decided to try our luck and run through the burn room. Blue Whisper felt inclined to go first. She backflipped into the corridor, and while the door was closing, I could see a slight glimpse of fear in her eyes. Then it was silent for a minute or so. Azhari looked like he got a headache, or as if someone was getting into his thoughts. Finally the doors opened and we all ran to the other side of the corridor. A friendly looking zombie called Maurice moaned at us, I think it was a sign of approval. We then found yet another door to knock on. A sophisticated voice answered: ‘Yes, come in.’ I entered a beautiful workplace filled with scrolls, books and a big chandelier. Hovering over his desk was a flying skull with shiny gemstone eyes. He was pondering about a text he was writing, too distracted to answer our questions. I offered him my help. Writing poetry for the dead is something you don’t get to do often, and it seems I’m pretty good at it. He was moved by my words, to say the least. He let us rummage through his death scrolls, and to our surprise, found our own. Oddly enough their was no cause of death noted.

We accepted this strange turn of events, and let Brownmane, Telemachus and Blue Whisper their hunger lead us to the dining room. Everyone’s favorite food was perfectly displayed on a long dining table. I may have drank too many glasses of  Pinot Noir, but the strangest thing then happened. As Brownmane was gulping down his big bowl of hearty stew, he started coughing, and began throwing up his organs. Then his appearance changed, as if he’d glitched. A filthy, long-bearded dwarf was now among us. Although he didn’t seem to be bothered by this transformation, I knew in an instant that this was only the beginning.
