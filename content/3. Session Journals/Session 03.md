### Summary

**Written by:** Forgor Fumblefoot

Ah, me name’s Forgor Fumblefoot, and let me tell ye the tale of our latest adventure on Nimbus 9th, 1370DR. We started our day in the bustling bazaar, lookin' to buy masks and fancy attire for the masked ball. A gnome salesclerk offered masks and clothes for any price we fancied. Me, bein’ the thrifty dwarf I am, settled for a simple paper bag mask, while me comrades got themselves fancier gear.

On our way to [[Great Bazaar#Mora's Hides and Armors |Mora’s Hides and Armor]], we got waylaid by Jillian Tealeaf's ‘sisters of the senses’. Poor lass couldn’t remember a thing about ‘em. They showed her a ‘century stone’, which she used to charm a satyr. These stones capture emotions and let ye re-experience ‘em by touchin’ ‘em.

When we finally reached Mora’s shop, we were mightily impressed. Her place was decked out with trophies from her monster huntin' days. Alongside the regular armor, there were special enchanted trophies worth a king's ransom. Realizin' we were short on gold, we decided to sell the scroll we found—the Scroll of Animated Death—at [[Bones of the Night]].

Before headin' there, we scoped out the Grand Astral Palace, where the ball was to be held. Bit underwhelmin', if ye ask me. To gather more info on Selene Shadowmoon, we visited the Hall of Information in the center of Sigil. After a bit of waitin', we learned Selene is 45 years old and still kickin'.

As dusk fell, we made our way to Bones of the Night. After a peculiar entrance through a trapdoor and ladder, we were greeted by a man who looked more dead than alive. His shop was filled with oddities like skulls and scrolls. We managed to sell the scroll for 300 gold—60 gold each.

Feelin' lucky, we headed to [[Fortune's Wheel]] casino. They had all sorts of gamblin' games. We had to buy 'razor leafs' for 10 gold pieces each to play. Jillian Tealeaf tried her luck at the slot machine but came up empty. Blue Whisper won herself a creepy larvae with a humanoid face, which she named ‘Dave’. As for me, I gambled all me razor leafs away, winnin' 4 teeth, 7 temporary hit points, and a little jig from the machines. Azhari and Jillian Tealeaf tried their hand at the big wheel but had no luck.

After losin' more than we won, we went to retrieve my hammer from the blacksmith. He told us it possessed hidden magic. Curious, I headed back to Bones of the Night and sold one of me newly won demon-like teeth for 30 gold.

We then moved as a group to the bank, only to find a crowd listenin' to faction spokesmen. One of the faction members noticed Azhari and convinced him to join their cause. The rest of us decided to part ways, leavin' just Jillian Tealeaf and meself. She played her lute, and I danced, earnin' us 20 gold!

Later, we found out that Azhari had been persuaded to join the faction called the [[Mind's Eye]]. And so ended our eventful day. Here’s hopin’ the next one brings us more gold and trouble!
