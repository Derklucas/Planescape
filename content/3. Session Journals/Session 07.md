### Summary

After teleporting out of Sigil, the party found themselves standing within the mysterious and ancient castle they'd stumbled upon in their quest to track down the rogue Modrone, R04M. In the aftermath of a fierce battle against two tieflings, who had been raiding the castle in the name of someone or something called Thlaarsh, the group chose to split up to explore their surroundings more thoroughly.

The castle's age was evident in every crack and dust-covered corner. Blue Whisper discovered a curious bedroom, long abandoned, yet littered with feathers and the telltale signs of a large bird having nested there. Meanwhile, Azhari, feeling drawn toward knowledge, came upon a study filled with old tomes and scattered papers. As he bent down to examine a few books strewn across the floor, a wave of cold air swept through the room. In an instant, a massive, winged creature materialized—a [[Nycaloth]], its eyes gleaming with malevolence, calling itself _Thlaarsh the Gore Drinker_.

With a roar, Thlaarsh attacked Azhari, his claws swinging with lethal precision. Startled but not helpless, Azhari called out for help, his voice echoing through the stone corridors. The rest of the party responded immediately. Jillian's quick feet carried her to Azhari's side, while Blue Whisper, always sharp in battle, moved silently into position. Forgor, the stout dwarf barbarian, charged into the fray, his great axe already raised high. 

Thlaarsh grinned wickedly before summoning a veil of _Darkness_, plunging the room into an impenetrable blackness. The creature's hulking form became nothing more than a shadow as he lashed out from the depths of the dark. For a moment, panic threatened to overtake the group—no one could see the Nycaloth, and his claws bit into their defenses with terrifying speed. But Jillian, drawing on her bardic talents, countered the dark with an enchantment of light, creating flashes that exposed the fiend’s position. Blue Whisper darted through the gloom, her psychic blades finding their mark in brief moments of clarity. Forgor swung with blind rage, trusting in his instincts, and Telemachus sent searing bolts of holy energy to strike the Nycaloth.

The battle raged, chaotic and fierce. Thlaarsh’s voice echoed with malice as he taunted them, reveling in the blood he spilled. But the party would not be bested. With a sudden surge of determination, Azhari raised his hand and summoned the arcane might of his patron. Two blazing _Eldritch Blasts_ shot from his hands, crackling with otherworldly power, and slammed into Thlaarsh’s chest. The fiend let out a final scream before his body dissolved into a puddle of ichor, the sickening black fluid seeping between the stones of the floor.

Panting and covered in the remnants of the battle, the group took a moment to catch their breath. In the silence that followed, the full weight of the encounter sank in—Thlaarsh, the creature haunting this castle, had been vanquished. But questions still remained.

Turning their attention back to the study, the party began a more thorough search. Amid the scattered papers, they discovered a strange glass skull, cracked and broken but covered in runes and symbols they didn’t recognize. Alongside it was a map of the Outlands, a potential clue for their next steps. Jillian and Azhari, their magical expertise combining, set to work on the skull. With time, care, and a bit of luck, they managed to repair it, and the artifact hummed to life. It was a [[Mimir]], a rare device capable of holding vast stores of knowledge about the planes.

The group tested the Mimir by asking it about several locations. Unfortunately, it had no information on [[Automata]], where they suspected R04M might be linked. However, it did reveal details about other Gate Towns, including [[Tradegate]] and [[Torch]]. The description of Torch, in particular, was ominous: _“Torch is a den of thieves built on the slopes of three volcanic spires that rise from a blood-red marsh. Formed from hardened molten rock, the pillars alternate in spewing blazing streams of pyrophoric gas, providing light and heat to the town.”_ The words hung in the air like a grim prophecy, hinting that their path might lead them to this volatile and dangerous place.

As they explored further, Blue Whisper discovered a hidden door leading to a small alcove containing four [[Beads of Prayer]], a treasure they pocketed for later use. Shortly after, they encountered a gnome by the name of Arcis, who wore the distinctive robes of the [[Fraternity of Order]]. Arcis expressed relief at the party’s defeat of the fiends, saying he could now return to his wife near Ecstacy. Before departing, he pointed out some important landmarks on their map and exchanged a formal greeting with Telemachus. Yet as Arcis disappeared from sight, something nagged at the group. The greeting... it was wrong. Subtle, but undeniably off. Suspicion crept into their minds—who exactly was Arcis?

Pushing that mystery aside for the moment, the party climbed higher into the castle, reaching a chamber with narrow windows looking out in every direction. In the center of the room stood a green crystal atop a stone pillar. Seated in a corner was a Githyanki woman with long white hair, her eyes closed as if in meditation. When the party roused her, she introduced herself as [[Zaythir]], a scholar who had been living in the castle. She revealed that the castle was no ordinary fortress—it was a [[walking castle]], capable of moving across the Outlands on its massive legs. Its name was _Iedcaru_.

Zaythir was grateful to the party for freeing the castle from the fiends’ control, and as a gesture of thanks, she offered the castle as a base for their future travels. She also confirmed that R04M had been here previously and had left the Mimir behind, though she couldn’t recall if the Modrone had come from or was heading toward [[Torch]]. Leading them to the room they had found earlier, the one dominated by a large stone statue, Zaythir demonstrated the castle's true power. Speaking the words _Tor'Vathar_, she activated the statue, and the massive figure lit up, projecting a shimmering map of the Outlands onto the round table.

As the party watched in awe, they felt the entire castle shift beneath them. The floor trembled as Iedcaru awoke, the ancient structure rising on its immense legs, ready to move at their command. Zaythir turned to the party with a calm smile and asked the question that would guide the next chapter of their journey:

"*Where do you want to go?*"
