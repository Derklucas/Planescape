### Summary

**Written by:** Telemachus Vaeloren

My companions and I found ourselves in [[Sigil]] with a few hours to spare before attending [[Lady Selene Shadowmoon]]’s ball. Our first destination was the [[Infinite Well]], a site renowned for its mysteries and potential insights into the universe.

It was a sight of profound awe, an abyss that seemed to stretch into eternity. As I peered into its depths, it felt as though an unseen presence was staring back at me. Mesmerized, I felt a prickling sensation at the back of my skull. The world around me faded into the background as my focus was entirely consumed by the enigma within the well, drawing me deeper into its mysterious depths.

I found myself suddenly standing in front of my friends, a wave of confusion washing over me. They stared at me as if I were an alien creature. It wasn't until Azhari, looking bewildered, asked what had happened to me that I realized something was amiss. He claimed I was different, no longer the high elf they had known, but a human. My mind started racing, immediately analyzing the situation. “I have always been like this,” I asserted, but their skeptical glances told me otherwise. Suppressing my frustration, I redirected my focus to the tasks at hand.

As evening approached, we readied ourselves for [[Lady Selene Shadowmoon]]’s ball. Most of us dressed in our best outfits, except for Forgor, whose unconventional choice—a paper bag—raised a few eyebrows. After a polite knock, Lady Selene herself opened it, dressed in mourning black with eyes tired and red from crying. Despite our inquiries, she offered no explanation for her distress. Jillian used her sensory stone imbued with serenity to gently draw out information from Selene. Eventually, she guided us to a garden where rare roses had been brutally decapitated under cover of night.

We commenced our investigation, finding no traces of magic or substantial clues, save for the gardeners' footprints. The garden was a fortress of privacy, making the intrusion perplexing. Blue Whisper slipped away to investigate the house without alerting the secretary or the head guard. I opted for a direct approach, accompanying the secretary to his office. The space was cramped and disorganized, reflecting his apparent lack of administrative competence. Engaging the secretary in conversation, I probed for any clues regarding motives to harm Selene. His explanations were evasive; he portrayed his role as overseeing transactions and dismissed the frequent occurrences of lost items as temporary misplacements. He mentioned that all the staff were his orphaned brothers, a peculiar detail.

Returning to the garden, we faced scrutiny over Blue Whisper's disappearance. Jillian bluntly spun a tale to explain her absence, claiming that Blue Whisper occasionally retreated to the bathroom to cry in solitude. Where she found the audacity to come up with such a transparent fabrication, is beyond me. To my surprise, the guard accepted the explanation without further question. Fortunately, Jillian managed to persuade the guard more effectively of our peaceful intentions to stay the night and investigate. It was a delicate agreement, but it held.

That night, as we mingled near their quarters, we observed the goblins gathered around a crackling fire from a bush in the shadows. Suddenly, they noticed us lurking and invited us to join their gathering. Azhari, ever keen to gather information, initiated a risky game of truth or dare. Despite my reservations, we agreed to participate. Unsurprisingly, Azhari chose truth, leading to a revelation that Lady Selene's mother had a liaison with their father. To me, this disclosure hinted at familial ties that implicated the goblins as Lady Selene's half-siblings.Bovenkant formulier

Following Azhari's revelation, the goblins toasted, and we reluctantly joined in. Aware of their high alcohol tolerance, I faced a dilemma: drink and avoid suspicion, or not drink and face suspicion. I reluctantly joined the toast. In the blink of an eye, I noticed Azhari discreetly passing her drink over her shoulder, just before the strong effects of the drink overtook me. Forgor's mocking laughter at our lack of tolerance only heightened my discomfort as the room spun and my thoughts blurred.

It was all a blur of action after the goblins retired to their quarters for the night. We swiftly formulated our plan: Jillian would explore the house, Azhari and Blue Whisper remained in the garden to watch for any developments, and I positioned myself with Forgor outside the entrance. Blue Whisper maintained her telepathic connection, ready to alert us to any sudden events.

Suddenly, without warning, the gardener, secretary, and head guard emerged. They cut off one of the roses and a blue portal appeared. Blue Whisper's urgent warning spurred us into action. We sprinted towards them, but I stumbled over Jillian in the garden, both of us still affected by the alcohol from earlier. By the time we reached the portal, it had closed, leaving us with a critical decision: wake Lady Selene or seize the opportunity to track the culprits before they vanished.

Opting for the latter, we plunged through the reopened portal into an exotic chamber filled with exotic aromas and foreign spices. Before us, the goblins hurriedly stowed away stolen treasures in vaults. Instantly, the realization hit: these items had been stolen from Lady Selene.

My mind raced with questions. Did the goblins feel justified in taking these treasures, perhaps as recompense for being marginalized within Lady Selene's family? Before I could delve deeper into this thought, Forgor's temper flared, and he launched into an attack.

The battle erupted into chaos, my own movements hampered by the lingering effects of alcohol. Despite conjuring my scythe to aid me, my strikes continually missed their mark.

Thankfully, Azhari remained clear-headed, employing her spells with precision. She ensnared the goblins with thorny growths, causing them pain with every move, and hexed another, disrupting their actions. Without her expertise, victory would have slipped through our fingers.

As we neared triumph, an unexpected sound shattered the air—a scream growing louder by the second. I turned to Blue Whisper, whose focused gaze indicated she was engaged in telepathic communication. Then, out of nowhere, Dave, a young larva, wrapped himself around the secretary, screeching in his ear. Blue Whisper's threat was clear: "Speak, or risk deafness."
