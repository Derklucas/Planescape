### Summary

After arresting the last remaining gnome servant of [[Lady Selene Shadowmoon |Lady Selene]], the party escorted him back through the portal to her mansion. The gnome, still shaking, recounted how his brother discovered that cutting off the head of a rose opened a portal to the bank of Abbathor, the dwarven god of greed. Every night, they attempted to rob the bank, but their plans always failed.

Lady Selene listened in silence, her expression darkening with each word. When the gnome finished, she spoke with a cold finality, "Your brother's folly has cost you your place here. You are dismissed."

Turning to the party, her tone softened. "You’ve done me a great service by bringing this to light. You will always be welcome at my gatherings. Perhaps even my sister’s wedding will have a place for you."

The party left the mansion and wandered through the twisting streets of Sigil. Suddenly, Peacekeepers from the [[Harmonium]] faction emerged, blocking their path.

"By order of the Harmonium," the lead Peacekeeper announced, "you are all under arrest for crimes against the multiverse."

The group tensed. Jillian Tealeaf protested, "Crimes against the multiverse? What nonsense is this?"

Azhari and Telemachus readied themselves for a fight, but Forgor Fumblefoot sighed and lowered his axe. "Ain't worth the trouble. I'll go quietly."

As the Peacekeepers moved in, Blue Whisper, ever the quick thinker, tossed a handful of ball bearings onto the ground. While the Peacekeepers stumbled, she slipped into the shadows, disappearing into the maze of streets. The rest of the party, despite their efforts, was overpowered and arrested.

From the rooftops, Blue Whisper moved like a shadow, following the Peacekeepers as they led her captured allies to the [[Barracks |Harmonium barracks]]. Below, she watched them ushered into a jail cell, their weapons and belongings stripped away. They were left to await a court case that would likely go poorly.

Just as Blue was preparing to descend, a shiver ran down her spine. She spun around, daggers at the ready, but instead of an enemy, she saw a Shadar-Kai stepping from the shadows. The stranger, with ashen skin and cold, calculating eyes, gave a slight nod. "[[Farrow]]," she introduced herself in a low voice. "I’ve been sent by a mysterious benefactor to assist you."

Blue Whisper's eyes narrowed. "Who sent you?"

Farrow only smirked, handing her a small, intricate token. "No time for questions. Show this to me after I transform. Then explain the plan."

Before Blue could respond, Farrow muttered an incantation, and her form rippled, transforming into a bald man dressed in Harmonium armor. "Name’s Josbert now," she said with a wink.

Blue Whisper quickly explained the plan. With a nod, “Josbert” shackled her hands loosely and led her into the barracks. The Harmonium officers inside greeted them with cheers. “Way to go, Josbert!” they called, clapping him on the back as he paraded Blue past them.

Reaching the cell where the others were held, “Josbert” turned back into Farrow in a swift, seamless motion. The group gasped as Farrow immediately set to work, dismantling the toilet with practiced ease, revealing an opening into the sewers below.

"Let’s go," Farrow whispered urgently, and one by one, they descended into the dark, fetid tunnels, the sound of distant cheers fading as they escaped into the night.

After navigating the winding, fetid sewers for what felt like hours, the group suddenly heard a strange huffing sound echoing through the tunnels. They turned a corner to find an empty cake plate lying on the damp ground, crumbs scattered across it. Next to the plate, a [[Cranium Rat Squeaker |rat with an exposed cranium]] lounged, its belly round and full. Before they could react, a voice echoed in their minds, eerily clear and united: _Do what you must, we have already won._

The group exchanged uneasy glances but decided to leave the rat to its glucose-induced slumber, quietly continuing on their way.

A little while later, they stumbled upon a strange sight: a small group of people clad in tattered clothes, their faces smeared with frosting and flour. Farrow's eyes narrowed as she recognized them. “The Cakers,” she whispered to the others. “They’re a forgotten faction here in Sigil. They believe the multiverse is actually a multi-layered cake.”

Before the group could fully process this, the Cakers’ leader, a round, jolly woman named Gertrube, waddled over to them, her face beaming with excitement. “You must join us for a cake and tea party! We’ve just baked the most divine layer.”

Jillian Tealeaf offered a polite smile. “Thank you for the offer, but we’re afraid we must be on our way.”

Gertrube looked slightly disappointed but nodded in understanding. “If you change your minds, you know where to find us!”

Hours later, the party finally emerged from the sewers, blinking as they stepped into the dim light of Sigil’s streets. “We’re here,” Farrow announced, pointing to a grand building adorned with glittering lights and a large, spinning wheel sign. “The [[Fortune's Wheel]] Casino.”

Inside, Farrow bid them farewell, disappearing into the crowd. The group was led by the staff to a luxurious room, its opulence a stark contrast to the filth they had just escaped. Clean clothes were laid out for each of them, along with a letter welcoming them from the casino’s owner and a small stack of ten tokens to gamble.
