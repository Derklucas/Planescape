The Heralds of Dust look after Sigil's dead in the Mortuary, the city's morgue. Situated between Blackshade Lane and Ragpicker's Square, the menacing stone structure rises above the Hive like a corpse from the grave. The Mortuary's towers bear low, gloomy domes with buttresses bristling with blades and windowless vaults clustered around the structure's base. Its dark, mournful halls reek of embalming fluids, their sterile tang sparing nostrils from viler odors trapped within the musty tombs.

##### Grim Workforce
The Dusters who run the Mortuary are the visage of death—slack jawed and bony framed, with unblinking eyes sunken into their gaunt, skeletal faces. Corpse collectors are often heard before they're seen, as their creaking wooden barrows are engulfed in clouds of buzzing insects. They wheel wagonfuls of bodies to Death's Door, a metal chute supervised by joyless undertakers, who pay collectors a pittance for each corpse they round up.

The Mortuary's uninviting halls echo with the moans of the Undead. [[Skeleton]]s and [[Zombie]]s perform menial tasks, such as cleaning or guard duty, while more intelligent Undead—such as [[Wight]]s, [[Vampire]]s, and death knights—serve the Heralds of Dust in high-ranking positions under their factol, the dreaded lich Skall.

##### Hall of Vigil
As Sigil's mirthless morticians, the Heralds of Dust are afforded the secrets of life and undeath. In the Mortuary's research area known as the Hall of Vigils, Dusters study deceased wayfarers from across the planes, preparing the corpses in accordance with an ever-widening archive of funeral rites before sending them through planar portals to distant burial grounds, faraway family crypts, or elemental planes for storage or cremation.

The funerary process often uncovers a creature's cause of death—and possibly the knowledge of how to kill others like it in the future. Assassins, poisoners, and hunters regularly attempt to infiltrate the Hall of Vigils in search of these secrets, only to die at the hands of the faction's Undead guards and be reanimated into their ranks.
