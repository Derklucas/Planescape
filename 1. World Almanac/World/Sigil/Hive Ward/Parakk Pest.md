In the Cage, rat catching is a family business. Over the years, Parakk Pest has become a household name in the City of Doors. The tiered shack stands out from the rest of the ward thanks to the giant rat skull that sits atop its roof. Generations of exterminators follow in the footsteps of its githzerai founder, Parakkâ€”whose name means both "servant" and "master." They adopt both his name and the duties that come with it. The githzerai eradicators, individually referred to as Parakks, service every ward in Sigil and are easily identified by their bright-pink skullcaps.

Sigil is a delicate ecosystem, and cranium rats play an important role in it. But while individual cranium rats are mostly harmless, swarms can rapidly become local menaces. The largest of these is the Us, a hyperintelligent hivemind based in Undersigil. When cranium rat populations grow to dangerous sizes, the Parakks step in to cull their numbers. However, some conspiracy theorists claim the ratcatchers secretly serve the rats, collecting rodents to add to the horde.

Particularly malignant infestations call for outside help. In such cases, Parakk Pest offers as much as 1 gp for a single cranium rat tail and larger sums to clear out entire swarms.
