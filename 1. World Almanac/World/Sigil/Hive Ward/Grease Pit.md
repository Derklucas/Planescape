The flavors of the multiverse converge at the Grease Pit, a noisy alley brimming with planar street food. Creatures come from far and wide to sample its delights or hawk them to hungry customers over the hubbub of the daily crowds.

The Grease Pit offers patrons a taste of the Outer Planes. Deep-fried meat skewers sizzle in bubbling oil taken from the battlefields of Acheron, marinating in a bath of rage and zeal. Meanwhile spicy dishes rise to infernal heats in devil-owned rotisseries, where sadistic pitmasters boast literal kicks that sear the taste buds of the uninitiated. Sobbing patrons cool their mouths on heavenly snow cones sold by dessert-loving devas, then later shred their tongues on face-puckering sour candies topped with caustic, gelatinous ooze. Portions range from bite-sized nibbles to bottomless portal buffets worthy of a giant's appetite.
