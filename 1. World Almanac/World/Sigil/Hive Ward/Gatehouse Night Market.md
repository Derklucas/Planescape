Honest shoppers stick to the Market Ward, where prices are firm and goods can easily be traced back to their sources. Customers interested in less reputable wares, however, haunt the after-hours stalls of the Gatehouse Night Market just a few blocks from the Gatehouse. Booths unfold from pocket dimensions at last light, their dealers lit by the neon glow of indifferent [[Will-o'-wisps]]: devils pawning stolen souls to rule-bending angels, interplanar fences selling stolen modron parts, demodands advertising jars of their liquefied cohorts as instant bodyguards, and the like. The night market relies on adventurers to settle disputes between vendors and their unrepentant clientele.
