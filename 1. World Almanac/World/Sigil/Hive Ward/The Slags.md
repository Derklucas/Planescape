The Slags were just another part of the Hive until a portal to the front lines of the Blood War, the eternal conflict between devils and demons, opened in the middle of the neighborhood. For weeks, weapons of war tore through the fragile shacks, reducing them to smoldering piles of rubble, and demons massacred anything with a pulse. Save for a few stragglers, the portal and its invaders are long gone, but their devastation remains. Scavengers scour the ashen wasteland for infernal supply caches, clashing with enforcers on the lookout for fugitives. Repeated calls for reconstruction go ignored in the Hall of Speakers.
