Fell, a dabus, runs a tattoo parlor in the Hive. From a distance, he looks like any other of his kind—a lean, purple-skinned figure in flowing robes, his horns protruding from a voluminous tuft of white hair atop his head. Shunned by the Lady of Pain and ostracized by his kin for declaring himself a priest of Aoskar, the dead god of portals, Fell now walks on the ground instead of floating above it. However, some of the dabus's magic remains, evident in the indelible designs he weaves into his visual rebuses.

Fell's Tattoos is a modest, oblong shack down the street from the Smoldering Corpse Bar. A pearl lightning bolt above the door marks the parlor's entrance. Inside, the quiet artist lets his handiwork speak for itself. Fell nods and smiles at his clients, producing wispy images that hang in the air and adjusting the shapes to their liking. The dabus applies each tattoo with a wave of his hand, wafting the design toward the client's skin where it grafts itself in vibrant ink.

##### Magic Tattoos
 The dabus's tattoos are tinged with magic. Most effects are minor—a temporary glow or shifting pattern—but some designs function as spell scrolls that burn away once used, singeing hair, fur, or scales in the process. As a devotee of Aoskar and longtime resident of Sigil, Fell knows the locations of hundreds of portals throughout the City of Doors and their keys.

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.
If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

For the duration, each of your melee attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can reach a target up to 15 feet away from you, as inky tendrils launch toward the target.
