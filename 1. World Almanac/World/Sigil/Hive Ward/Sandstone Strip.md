A sliver of tightly clustered buildings stands between the orderly Clerks' Ward and the chaos of the Hive. Named for its granular, red cobblestone streets, the Sandstone Strip shelters charlatans and scoundrels who take care of their own, along with anyone else burned by administrative backlash from Sigil's more powerful residents. When bureaucrats abuse their stations, the ward's rank and file rely on adventurers to even the scales and ensure Sigil's laws apply to all its citizens, not just those at the bottom.
