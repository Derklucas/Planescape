Sparkling rays converge on the stained-glass windows of Heart's Fire, a luminous temple devoted to gods of fire, truth, and light. Golden, wavy blades hover atop the house of worship like flames. Nicknamed the Sun of Sigil, it glows each day at dawn.

Recently, Heart's Fire has become the subject of gossip throughout the Temple District. The temple's former high priest, a deva named Ephemera, was called away on a divine errand. Before departing, the angel appointed a controversial replacement to guide the fane in their stead: Mihr, a lawful good horned devil who turned their back on the Nine Hells long ago. Kind and merciful, the new high priest hopes the congregation will see their redeemed nature, but some of the temple's clergy refuse to accept Mihr as the true high priest.
