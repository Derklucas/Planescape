Hushed streets surround the Barracks, a wide compound of cold granite at the opposite end of the Lady's Ward from the Armory. Stoic and impenetrable, the lofty fortress houses the rank and file of the Harmonium, Sigil's militant guards and enforcers. Taciturn sentries march along its spiked, gray-slate roof, gazing over a largely deserted precinct. Life this close to the Hardheads is a double-edged sword. While local businesses—of which there are few—enjoy on-demand security, their proprietors must be spotless in the eyes of the law or suffer crackdowns from overzealous disciplinarians in the faction, who enforce Factol Sarin's orders without question.

**Entering the Barracks.** The Barracks are open to all enthusiastic peacekeepers, though Hardheads stop and interrogate anyone who ventures past the clasped stone hands over the stronghold's arched entrance. Straitlaced recruiters pressure visitors without a clear faction allegiance to enlist in the Harmonium and reap its benefits.

**Parade Grounds**. Composed of four identical sections and the squat towers that join them, the Barracks surround a wide parade ground. The Harmonium shows its strength within the quad through drills, marches, and other ceremonial displays. Beyond the grounds lie classrooms and living quarters, along with the faction's archives, which include current and past Harmonium patrol routes, active members and their ranks, and official arrest records.

**Recruiting the Harmonium**. With an official writ from Factol Sarin, the factol of an allied faction, or an influential figure in Sigil, one can gain temporary protection services or extra muscle in the form of a few reliable guards who stubbornly obey every city ordinance.
