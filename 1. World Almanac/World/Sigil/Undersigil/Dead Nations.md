Bathed in leaden mist, the Dead Nations are an expanse of derelict necropolises and forgotten tombs, their inscriptions worn by decades of neglect. The treasures of these vacant sepulchers seem ripe for the taking, but here the dead are more organized than they might appear.

A decrepit monarch, the Silent King, presides over the Dead Nations and their undead populace, but his throne is also his prison. The Silent King's throne bestows a mantle of authority on its occupant, but it demands a grim toll. Only the living can sit on the mirthless, high-backed chair, and only death can free them from its numbing grip. Ghouls, skeletons, and zombies pledge fealty to the Silent King and enforce his will in the Realm Below. They are bound to serve their ruler until either he's killed or he wastes into oblivionâ€”leaving his seat available for its next ruler.
