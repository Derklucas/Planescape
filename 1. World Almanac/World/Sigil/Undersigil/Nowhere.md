When a faction falls apart or Sigil tolerates it no longer, its members can join the ranks of another faction, abandon the city entirelyâ€”or flee to Nowhere. The huddled welter of ramshackle tenements lies deep in the bowels of Undersigil, a doleful refuge for criminals and stubborn believers who refuse to renounce their allegiances. Within Nowhere's dark warrens, criminals peddle seedy wares to dwindling factions, some consisting of just one member. Grungy alleys become impromptu forums as desperate factols hope to rekindle interest in outdated ideologies and poach each other's members.

The following are just a few of the non-ascendant factions headquartered in Nowhere:

- **The Coterie of Cakes (Cakers**) is a destitute band of rosy-cheeked bullies who assert the multiverse is a great, multilayered cake and that baked goods are its fundamental unit of trade.
- **The Revolutionary League (Anarchists**) were once a popular faction that fell away to disorganization. This mishmash of misfits and outcasts vows to dismantle society.
- **The Undivided (Deniers**) is a faction composed wholly of creatures native to Sigil. They believe those who pass through planar portals are destroyed and replaced with clones.
