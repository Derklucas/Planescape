The Tower Sorcerous is a spiny spire of unknown material, its surface shifting like a puddle of oil. The structure has no visible doors or windows save for eight balconies that jut from its twisting frame. Although the tower's surfaces are impenetrable to most, Incantifers step into the tower as if it were porous, leaving ripples behind them as they enter and emerge.

When the Tower Sorcerous disappeared from Sigil, it left behind an empty lot. The business that went up in its place, Fretter's Fetters and Fritters, was destroyed when the tower suddenly reappeared. Until recently, most folk believed the Lady of Pain consigned the tower and its inhabitants to the Mazes. Few know the circumstances of the tower's disappearance and reappearance, or what machinations brew within.
