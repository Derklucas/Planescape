Creatures of every kind take a soak in the Flame Pits, a planar bathhouse whose pools swirl with bubbling acid, molten lava, and liquid shadow. Unicorns, bariaurs, and various Fiends get their hooves trimmed in grooming rooms, and galeb duhr sigh as they settle into boiling tubs of mud. Patrons dry off in front of warm vents tied to windy desert realms or the chilling gales of Pandemonium.

The baths are run by Laril Zazzkos, a githzerai uniter (see Morte's Planar Parade), and her staff of rough-scrubbing mephits. Abrasive as a wiry brush, the eagle-eyed githzerai spends her days berating patrons who fail to observe the bathhouse's strict "no running" policy or warning those who get too close to the wrong tubsâ€”an occasionally fatal mistake. At heart, Laril is a rebel. Many of the tubs in her bathhouse have false bottoms for harboring fugitives or smuggling contraband. At least one of her tubs hides a passage into the depths of Undersigil.
