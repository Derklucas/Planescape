The chief attraction of the ward is the Great Bazaar, a vast plaza of shops where anything and everything can be found. Boisterous throngs of shoppers crowd its bustling avenues at all hours, doing business with vendors from every corner of the multiverse.

The Great Bazaar is a cosmopolitan sampling of the planes and the goods they have to offer. Though more scandalous merchandise typically finds its way to the [[Gatehouse Night Market]], the bazaar has anything a traveler could want, so long as they can find it in the open market's constant commotion. Scents collide in the winding stalls: warm, right-angled bread loaves prepared fresh by modron bakers; spotted mushrooms hocked by bullywug grocers; and perfumed holy water sold by winged Celestials. Vibrant produce dangles from the leafy awnings of living plant stalls, and masterwork armors forged from rare metals bear insignias from blacksmiths on other worlds.

**Free League Presence.** The Free League congregates in the Great Bazaar. Although the Harmonium patrols the bazaar's busy avenues, it's the members of the Free League who capture thieves and decide whether to turn them over to justice. With no formal meetinghouse, members of the free-willed faction hold impromptu assemblies in cramped market tents or unused warehouses.

### Stalls
Characters can purchase any adventuring gear in the Player's Handbook at normal cost in the Great Bazaar, though shrewd bargainers can secure their purchases for less. The Bazaar Shops table details a few vendors one might encounter in the bazaar.
