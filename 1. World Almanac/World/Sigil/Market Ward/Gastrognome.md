Diners never know what to expect from the Gastrognome, an intimate, upscale eatery that looks like a giant metal olive. Distinguished and inventive, its proprietor, [[Celci Nugglebelly]], is a worlds-class chef who never cooks the same dish twice. They cater to adventurous taste buds and deep appetites, challenging expectations about food and the forms it takes. A three-course dinner at the Gastrognome might consist of a gravity-defying salad cloud, a whispering Shadowfell steak topped with bioluminescent blight, and a deceptively simple chocolate tart that carries the sweet taste of revenge. The owner frequently hires adventurers to track down rare ingredients to delight and impress future diners.
